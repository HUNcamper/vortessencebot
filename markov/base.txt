That should keep the Freeman safe. We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who has acquired an almost messianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens. It's me, Gordon! Barney from Black Mesa. Hey! Man, Gordon! You stirred up the hive. You'll find the launcher for your rockets up in the lighthouse, Freeman. [Scraping...] I don't know what you're doing, Freeman, but I'm warning you against it! Coming. Get down! [Dog Angry] I can't leave my father. [Hunter-Chopper Charging] Hold it. Oh all right, damn it, if that's what it takes! [Button sound] This is my third transfer this year. Laser activated anti-personnel mine acquired. I don't know what you can possibly hope to achieve, apart from your own annihilation. Let me remind all citizens of the dangers of magical thinking. Much better. Let's go! Your assistance, brother! Is this the Freeman we see before our eyes? *pain!* Voice system deactivated. Gordon, why don't you position yourself near the panel over there and wait for my word? Here, brother! Ammunition! [Explosion!] Hey, look what he left behind! Power restored ... 55 percent. If any more citizens come through I'll send them up to find you. Well, Gordon, go ahead. Slip into your suit now. This is bullshit! We weren't entirely sure you were ever going to get around to that, human loyalties being what they are. Get that thing away from me! Uh oh. Look at the monitor. He ended the Seven Hours War by managing Earth's surrender. There it is. The Overwatch Nexus. Looks like they're mobilizing, big-time. You can sort of see the gate from here. I'll show you when we get to streetlevel. Throw your switch, Gordon. Well, now what? Freeman must excuse us. It is rude of us to commune by flux shifting in front of those whose vortal inputs are impaired. range 9 meters [Turret Ping] Come on in, Gordon. I'd like to help you, but it's out of the question. Isaac, are you there? And another of your friends arrived several days ago. [Manhack Engine] [Rollermine Chirp] [Gunship bullet--Near miss!] Forward! Uh-oh. This way, Dr. Freeman You coming? I think the teleport exploded just as we were porting out. Power restored ... 65 percent. Dr. Kleiner! Let us out! Doc, come in, are you there? Use extreme caution when approaching the Bridge. Radio silence from that outpost leads me to believe it has come under Combine control. Still, you're clearly the right man for the job! [Dog Angry] *pain!* Power restored ... 60 percent. [Door Sound] We really can't afford to get noticed. [Motor starts] Looks like you're gonna be the last one through. [Engine starting in water] Caution, Freeman! See you in a little while, Gordon. What? Oh dear, you're right, I almost forgot. Barney, I'll give you the honor. range 20 meters In order to be true to our nature, and our destiny, we must aspire to greater things. We have outgrown our cradle. It is futile to cry for mother's milk, when our true sustenance awaits us among the stars. Looks like you've made yourself some friends. The capture of Eli Vance is an event of major significance, make no mistake. And while it's true that conceivably we could have taken him at almost any time in the last several years, the manner of his capture may prove to have unexpected benefits. You, there! Unity of purpose, the shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread. [Heartbeat...] [Sniper Shot] You want him to take the coast road? He won't last five minutes on foot. It's spawning season for the antlions. Hush! [Crow Death] Try grabbing those barrels from that ledge up there. [Combine Radio: Tactical] Don't step on the sand! It makes the antlions crazy! Dog, go get your ball. As you wish. The honor is ours. That's one way of looking at it. You understand, I've gotta stay and help any stragglers. Huh... [Metal breaking] All clear. It's a manhack! Help! *moan* Oh man, now what? Gordon Freeman, you're here! Take the gravity gun, Gordon. It's designed for handling hazardous materials, but we mainly use it for heavy lifting. Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest. And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until...well, let's just say your hour has come again. You have plunged humanity into freefall. Come on, Gordon. We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! Turrets! Look out! Not right now. You'll find more help up at Station 7, just a few bends up the river. It's the old red barn. Take it. This will only anger it at first, but if you can survive long enough to make several direct hits, you'll be rewarded with a prize worthy of any mantlepiece. Come on, come on. [Button sound] Manhacks! I could have told you that was pointless, Dr. Freeman. [Hunter-Chopper Damaged] Tourniquette applied. That's enough, Dog. Let's even the odds a little We're closing in on a reliable local teleport technology, something the Combine still hasn't mastered. I'm relying on you to fail again, Dr. Freeman. Just as I relied on you at Black Mesa. Yes. I'm talking to you. I wish I had a dime for every time somebody said that. Uh, Doctor Freeman, come on. That's enough of that. Instinct, therefore, must be expunged. [Antlion Pain] You're more than qualified to finish his research yourself. In the meantime... That's it. My Dad and Dr. Mossman...they were captured in the fighting. Vortigaunts tracked them to Nova Prospekt, the converted prison up the coast. If you could meet me there, Gordon, then together we might have a chance of getting them out. Lead the way. No! Don't worry. He's coming with me *pain!* God I'm hungry. What do you mean? Dr. Freeman! Since you shut off the suppressor and opened the gate, we can really move people through now! The Combine's gonna feel the squeeze! We dropped a crate of rockets, coming across the plaza. If you can make it there, you should have everything you need to take down these striders. Looks okay. Sometimes I wonder how I ended up with you. Uh-oh. Everything all right, Doctor Kleiner? He's dead. Help! over here! Get your car, Doc. You won't get far on foot. There is more to the Freeman than meets the eye. It's our guest of honor. What a pleasure. Cover me, brother. That's right, Barney. This is a red letter day. We'll inaugurate the new teleport with a double transmission! And things were going so well. [Plastic breaking] Gordon, stay put. We'll get you out of there. There he is! All we have is yours. [Beep] Hurry! Alyx my dear, you have your mother's eyes. But your father's stubborn nature. Gordon, if you please? I'm eager to see if your old suit still fits. I'm not even gonna tell you to shut up. Experimental hyper-velocity weapon acquired. Just be glad you don't live there. Hurry. Administering medical attention. I have laid the foundation for humanity's survival, and not as we have narrowly defined ourselves, but as something greater than we could ever imagine. Something we can only now begin to glimpse. [Wood breaking] You got it Yes, yes, Eli, bit of a holdup on this end. You and me both. Dr. Kleiner! That picture, and Alyx, were all I managed to carry out of Black Mesa. Ow! It also requires planning and forethought that run in direct opposition to our neural pre-sets. Stand back. It's gonna blow! Damn tiddly-winks! *pain!* Dad! [Gate Sound] Roof access is this way. Get off the road! [Button sound] This is a Combine filter-field. If you've never dealt with one of these before, you can sometimes break the switch by lobbing stuff through. Keep moving! Now, put it in the trash can. The Combine's sweeping the area! I'll bet you did. [Slow Geiger tick] Medical damage repaired. [Eye-scan Failed] Why go on? How'd she...? Freeman, ammo! Good idea, Doc. Speak English. Sorry, Doc. All right, I think I can bring him in. I'll take him from here. I wouldn't say that too loud. Come closer. All right, thanks, Gordon. Now let's clear outta here. [Lever sound] [Button sound] Tell me, Dr. Freeman, if you can. You have destroyed so much. What is it, exactly, that you have created? Can you name even one thing? I thought not. Churr galing chur alla gung... Dr. Freeman. How dare you even mention her! Incoming! Automatic target acquisition system. May their paths become dark and slippery; and may the angel of the Lord afflict them. Dr. Kleiner, there's really no time. Truly it is the Freeman. Over here! Fantastic work, Izzy. [Combine Button sound] Freeman, we could be of use to you. Will do! I just finished mounting an ammo crate on the back. Near death. range 3 meters Hey, Dog! Not there! You can't get through that way! Gordon Freeman? The Colonel is expecting you. [Zombie Death] The time is now ... 7 PM The Freeman will have need of these pheropods on the paths ahead. Gather them now. Have a very safe day. No, we're not leaving you. I'm hurtin, Gordon. Hey. it's Freeman! You're not leaving without me. Oh my god. How about that? *pain!* Go on ahead. I'll disrupt the next level of security, and catch up with you when I can. This'll do nicely. Did the lungfish refuse to breathe air? It did not. [Zombie Pain] There's only one Hedy. *cheers* Head for the lighthouse, Freeman, there's rockets in there! *muffled beating* I'm hurt pretty bad... [Turbo Off] We cannot heal a moving target. Soldiers! Wait till you hear from me. You'll have to wait your turn like everybody else. There he is! Whatever you're doing, stop at once! Blood plasma administered. Power level is ... 100 percent. range 17 meters So you've warmed it up for us. Good. And just in time. No. No! The gate is open. If I ever get my hands on Dr. Breen... There we are. That gun came off one of the same hunter-choppers you're up against. I always like to bring a little irony to a firefight. [EMP Device Burst!] Thank god, it's done. Let's get the hell outta here. Lamarr. Come out of there. Oh don't give me that look. Take this medkit. That was close! We're surrounded! Hold on! Where was I? Oh, yes. Dr. Kleiner compressed the Xen Relay far beyond anything he imagined at Black Mesa. I know you will. Lamarr? Hedy! No! Just a couple more seconds... Dr. Freeman! It's a mess out there. This close to the Citadel they've turned the streets over to Striders. I think we can push them back if we can just get to high ground. Get in here! Hurry! Come on, Gordon, now we've really gotta hurry. We're picking up radio chatter. They're looking for your car. I also detect some unspoken questions. Do our benefactors really know what's best for us? What gives them the right to make this kind of decision for mankind? Will they ever deactivate the suppression field and let us breed again? Right along there. And watch your step. Morphine administered. Leave it alone. [Reloading!] Nothing of the sort Watch the headhumpers, Gordon. [Bootsteps on stairs!] [Button sound] Communications interface online. [Can't Use] We've gotta head back to the lab. Come on, Gordon. High impact reactive armor activated. Draw forth a sword and sheathe it in those that afflict me; say to my soul: I am thy salvation. [Alarm] [Plaster Breaking] How could one man have slipped through your force's fingers time and time again? How is it possible? This is not some agent provocateur or highly trained assassin we are discussing. Gordon Freeman is a theoretical physicist who had hardly earned the distinction of his Ph.D. at the time of the Black Mesa Incident. I have good reason to believe that in the intervening years, he was in a state that precluded further development of covert skills. The man you have consistently failed to slow, let alone capture, is by all standards simply that--an ordinary man. How can you have failed to apprehend him? [Rollermine Jolt] [Lever sound] Damn her, I don't believe this! You got that from me. We're in Nova Prospekt, and we're running the Xen emulation for the first time. Are you ready for us? If he hasn't, well... Gladly we accompany. Head for the roof! There's no time to lose! You're not gonna hurt that thing from down here, Gordon. We'll have to shut it down from inside. Calm yourself. Keep it going, Gordon! I'm staying put. You go on. I've made a few modifications, but I'll just acquaint you with the essentials. Now, let's see... Welcome to City 17. [Dog Disappointed] Node and nexus, feed upon this life! 50 Okay, I'm ready. Almost there, brother! Good job, Gordon. Would we model ourselves on the trilobite? Look to your own salvation! Okay, let's head for the gate and I'll open it while the coast is clear. Over there! Black Mesa East to Station 6. Do you read? Dr. Freeman is on his way downriver. Lend him the airboat and give him all the help you can. Repeat. Gordon Freeman has returned! It is critical he reaches Black Mesa East. Freeman. The Hacks! What neither you nor I can do is convince that rabble in the streets to give up their senseless struggle. You better get going. [Metal Destroyed] Please no! Ah, yes! Gordon Freeman! I understand if you don't wish to discuss this in front of your friends. Live again, brother! [Blip] [Pistol Shot] Combine! Excuse me. This is bad. Get down outta sight! I'll come find you! Huh... Inner shields are coming down. Look out! [Door Sound] We've got three generators to disable. Might as well start with this one. Minor fracture detected. Heh. Don't get my dad started on Dr. Breen. [Crow Squawk!] Go on through, Gordon. This way, Gordon. *pain!* We remember the Freeman. We are coterminous. Gordon, lob a couple grenades, that'll clear 'em out. High velocity stealth crossbow acquired. Go right on down to the docks there, and we'll bring it out for you. Listen for directions from the crane operator. Oh my God, it's Freeman! Chemical detected. The switch, Dr. Freeman. You haven't seen a bit of it yet. [Wood breaking] Morphine administered. Power restored ... 35 percent. [Warning Voice: Confiscation Field Activated] Warning: Blood toxin levels detected. Watch your turrets. But your father's stubborn nature. Go ahead, Dog, throw! Gordon Freeman! You're just in time, Doc. We've got to move out before the Combine picks us up. We're just getting ready to pull out. Beware! So much for Doctor Freeman. Stop! Throw another, Dog. Warning: Power movement system overload. We never dreamed to meet you in corporeal form. He's right here. Prisoners! Let 'em out, Gordon. We could use their help. I agree, it's a total waste. Fortunately, the resistance has shown it is willing to accept a new leader. And this one has proven to be a fine pawn for those who control him. Over here! Hey, take care of yourself. Uh, careful there. [Wood breaking] Now, attend well. Apply pressure to your pheropod, to signal the antlions in your command to follow you. Hah. Done. Ammunition depleted. We've been helping people escape the city on foot. It's a dangerous route to my father's lab, through the old canals. Today we're finally on the verge of having a better way. The Freeman must stand still. What? What are you talking about? God, this is taking forever! [Metal straining] Sorry it took me so long. No! You're not the first to come through here by a ... Emergency. User death imminent. Evacuate area immediately. Take this. Hey, thanks, Freeman. Come on! Dad? Heal thyself, brother! [Hunter-Chopper Bomb Ping] [Button sound] [Combine APC Rocket Fire] There he is. [Gutterpipe rattling] Take it easy, Gordon. [Crow Alert] Let's concentrate on the task at hand. That's not who I think it is, is it? Go on! [Deny] I'm not even gonna tell you what that reminds me of. This is not open to debate, Dr. Mossman. [Ricochet!] I'm gonna stay and hold down this spot. Let me get out of your way Clear! [Alarm] The grave holds nothing worse for you. Is that really you? I can't believe you found me. [Antlion Guard Confused] It's all right. Bring it on! will you give your child the chance her mother never had? That's what you said last time. Power restored ... 85 percent. Don't worry, I won't look Go on up and connect the skybridge. We need to let reinforcements come through from every possible direction. We can't leave Judith here either. [Canister Opening] Reload, Dr. Freeman! He's bluffing, Gordon. Don't listen to him. Get in here Cover me while I reload! All right! One more now! Come on, Gordon! [Button sound] Then I'll need you to hit it with a burst from the gravity gun. [Antlion Attack] [Nearby Zombie Alert] No! Take the canals, right? They'll get you to Eli's lab. It's a dangerous route, but there's a whole network of refugees and they'll help you if they can. [Antlion Guard Death] *cheers* 8 [End Charging] Administering Medical Attention. Stop it! Go on, get in there. I can't get through. But inseparable from Instinct is its dark twin, Superstition. [Combine APC Cannon Fire] Help yourself to supplies and keep moving. Up there! Headcrabs! Okay, Doc, you'll have to go on foot from here. There's a secret path along the cliffside, but no one's going anywhere until we fight off this attack. Having you here to fight alongside us will make a big difference for morale. Ready and waiting! Power restored ... 95 percent. Gordon, this is Dog. My Dad built him to protect me when I was a kid. Gordon, use the turrets! Antitoxin administered. 100 percent. Oh crap! Incoming! Laser guided rocket acquired. Hacks! Yes! [Steam hiss] [Klaxon!] Gordon, extend the skybridge. Well, come on Gordon. We don't want to keep her waiting. [Turret Death] CPs! [Wood breaking] You humans, always in the qualidity. Before they spot us! We are still here. Dear me. I'll take care of that. Hey, you've got Eli's gravity gun! Try giving those shields a jolt and see if you can shake em up a bit. [Button sound] Stop, you're killing me! If it were a snake, it woulda bit me. We expected as much And reap we shall. [Door Sound] Pile up some stuff to get through that window, and keep going till you're in the plaza. Sure thing. Perhaps we will serve you better here. *pain!* Use your gravity gun to flip the car over again. Don't worry, Gordon, we'll [Metal Clang] [Steam Hiss] Be glad you're not the guy they're looking for. Move along! Should we bury him here? Well, Dr. Freeman, you're a regular antlion now. The time is now ... 11 PM Don't be so sure of that. The Combine use a peculiar pulse-forming network with a very long rise-time. It takes quite a while to recharge. [Antlion Attack] [Wood straining] Gunship! The manhacks just keep coming. They're never gonna stop! Good job, Gordon. Throwing that switch and all? I can see your M.I.T. education really pays for itself. What are we going to do? Ha ha! Like that? Hey, Gordon! [Alarm!] Let me assure you that the suppressing field will be shut off on the day that we have mastered ourselves...the day we can prove we no longer need it. Climb on in and fire her up. Warning. Power movement system overload. Lamarr! There you are! That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day. For once the lesser master lay defeated, we knew the greater must also fall in time. [Vortigaunt Beam Attack] Dropship! Coming in over the road! If you move we cannot help you. Let's go! range 5 meters Take hold of a weapon and shield, and rise to help me. Dad, I'm not saying goodbye. *pain* [Door Sound] The Freeman does us honor. Our purpose is mutual. A man of science, with the ability to sway reactionary and fearful minds toward the truth Wanna bet? HEV - critical failure. Failure. [Crash!] At least get that suit juiced up, Gordon. I must say, Gordon, you come at a very opportune time. Alyx has just installed the final piece for our resurrected teleport. Follow Freeman! [Barnacle Death] [Crane magnet grab] Attend, now, and learn to shepherd antlions with this so-called bug-bait. Come back up, Dr. Freeman. The car's on the pier. We'll make sure you're not followed. *pain!* [Turret dies] You coming? Good throw. Well, that's that. All in one and one in all. Warning: Biohazard detected. Incoming dropship! Hey, catch! It draws power from inside the building so that's where we've got to go. 3 Watch out, he's gonna-- I'm sorry, Gordon. Look for the exit signs. All clear! Don't forget Hawaii. *moan* [Scanner Click] Get going now. Yes, Barney, and I'm no longer alone. I'm sorry, Wallace. You're all out of time. [Crash!] Once he teleports, the whole thing will tear apart. The beam is unshielded. We'll be cooked in the singularity. Yes, forward. We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock. [Empty] Take a look at this, Gordon. Good thing you found us. Uh-oh. I was afraid you weren't going to make it. [Hunter-Chopper Rocket Fired] Greetings, brother! And so we meet at last. I can reprogram these turrets to attack the enemy. You set them up to defend the control room. [Scanner Damaged] This here's the dam. It's just up ahead. Bouncebombs! [Ignition Spark] I can't leave without Lamarr. Now where did she get to? We know you. You remember my wife Azian, don't you? [Eye-scanner Activate] Excuse me, Gordon. But where's Dr. Kleiner? Gordon! Help! Here they come! Gordon. What happened to the gravity gun? It must be drawing power from the Citadel. Oh yeah! When I told you Dog liked to play fetch, I didn't tell you who'd be fetching, did I? *pain!* Incoming! Onward! [SMG Grenade Launch] Then, where is he? Ga la lung... Help us! You waiting for somebody? Anything you say, Doc. [Start Charging] Warning. Extreme heat damage detected. Well, he earned it. Lung gah... Seek medical attention. Hey, over here! [Combine Radio: Chatter] Station 12, come in. Station 12, do you read? No, not at all! It was a calculation error, not a mechanical problem. Seek medical attention. Keep going, friend! That station was raided but there's others up ahead. Where art thou, brother? Oh my God, it's Freeman! The blow you struck at Nova Prospekt was taken as a signal to begin the uprising. There's our gate. Let me just get it open. Nonsense. Your talents surpass your loveliness. Emergency. User death imminent. Here we stay. I can't go in there while it's activated, but your suit should protect you. Look for some vulnerability in the core. What's going on Alyx? Judith? What's happening? Sorry. Lead on, Freeman! What are we waiting for? I can hack the gate controls and hold it open till we're through, but you're gonna have to watch my back while I'm working. [Camera Click] Good catch. I guess you should go with Alyx. I ask you, what greater endeavor exists than that of collaboration? Dr. Freeman, you won't get anywhere on foot. Come back up and get in the car. Overwatch! Alyx, honey... [Barnacle Grunt] In order to be true to our nature, and our destiny, we must aspire to greater things. We have outgrown our cradle. It is futile to cry for mother's milk, when our true sustenance awaits us among the stars. Excellent. [Scurrying in airduct] You better hurry. Gordon! You must remember us from Black Mesa. Here you go. Armor Compromised. [Forcefield hum] Watch what you're doing. [APC Siren!] The time is now ... 8 PM I'm going to head back to the security station and try to patch into your suit radio. [Growl...] [Thump! Thump! Thump!] 9 millimeter fully automatic weapon acquired. Ready when you are! Looks okay. [Zombie Alert] Another one, Dog. The time is now ... 12 PM I have been laid down in a pit of darknesses and the shadow of death. And thy anger has pressed down upon me; and all thy cares have come down upon me. And from this bed I cry out for the kindling of thy Light! The time is now ... 1 PM Yes! Did I not tell you to seek the church? That is all. If I talk to you out here, we'll both be in trouble. [Crowbar Swoosh] We shall prevail. If we want to get through these shields, we'll have to take out the generators one at a time. Open fire, Gordon! Looks nasty in there. Good thing you've got that suit. [Door Sound] Oh my god! What was that? Word to the wise: keep it to yourself. They're coming, Gordon. I find it helpful at times like these to remind myself that our true enemy is Instinct. All right, let me see if I can get this open He's been taken to Nova Prospekt. The vortigaunts tracked the ship that made off with him and Judith Mossman. While the trains are still running, I'm going to hitch a ride. Can we not convince you otherwise? Yeah, longer if we're lucky. [Headcrab Threat] Okay, Gordon, you heard him. Head for the horse! [Schwick!] Damn vorts. 90 603, unlawful entry. Ah, no! Same here. Okay, Dog, let's play catch with Gordon. Come on in. [Sniper Death] [Button sound] Your mind is in the gutter. I'm gonna stay here in case any others come through. Gotta keep the railway alive. They'll be coming from the roof. Ah, Gordon Freeman. Why don't you take a spin around the beach until you've got a feel for the car. When you're done, head for the slope down by the water. Look out, brother! Behind you! Zombies! I'm gonna stay and hold down this spot. Let's get out of here. Get your car in the garage. Power assist movement activated. [Crowbar Thwap!] No visual on UPI at this time. [Turbo On] You ready for this? Good luck out there, buddy. You're gonna need it. The time is now ... 9 PM Pardon me. Certainly not! Never fear, Gordon, she's de-beaked and completely harmless. The worst she might do is attempt to couple with your head. Fruitlessly! Near death. Evacuate area immediately. Alyx! Honey... Turret! Dr. Freeman. You really shouldn't be out there. At the moment of synapse, as I teleport, this chamber will be bathed in deadly particles that have yet to be named by human science. Perhaps when I have the leisure to do the work myself, I'll name one after you. That way you won't be completely forgotten. Gordon would never make any kind of deal with you. The Eli Vance was our first collaborator. Blood loss detected. Help! Electrical damage detected. Okay I'm going. They'll be looking for you now! Let's get moving! [Bugbait Splat] I'm picking up a lot of incoming soldiers, hold the fort til I get there. We seem to have developed a very slow teleport. The so-called One Free Man. I have a question for you. How could you have thrown it all away? It staggers the mind. Did you realize your contract was open to the highest bidder? Freeman, ammo! Get going, Gordon. I've got Dr. Kleiner in a safe spot. Now we can join up with Barney. What is it? Insufficient power. HEV shutting down. Ready, willing, and fully enabled! Stop that! Ha! No you don't! Hey, hey, he's back! I'm getting him outta there! Just so. Okay, I'm good. [Combine Button sound] Good boy! Alyx! Gordon! It has come to my attention that some have lately called me a collaborator, as if such a term were shameful. Password! We remain unconvinced Great work, Doc, you've still got the touch. Look. Look. If you are truly the Freeman, we salute you. Gunship Okay, I'm ready. Sorry. *laughter* *pain!* First, we gotta get into the Nexus building. I am outnumbered! Cover me! Come on, everybody! Thanks, Doc. [Flaregun shot!] There's supposed to be a high route over the rooftops, but... I've never been that way myself. Good job, Gordon. I'll see you on the ground. He's running. [Strider shot--Near miss!] This suggests an entirely new line of investigation. I don't feel anything anymore. It's Dr. Breen. There he is! You made it! Remember him from Black Mesa? Your old Administrator? Hm. The Freeman knows best. He should be in here. Let me just get this open. Use the gravity gun, Gordon. You're Barney's old friend, aren't you? Maybe you can help him. Snipers trapped him on that warehouse roof. He was going for a cache of grenades, but I doubt he can get to them now. Go on, Dr. Freeman. One down! Up there! The tether is cut. If I could live my life over again Barney... You're not an animal person? When the singularity collapses, I will be far away from here. In another universe, as a matter of fact. You, on the other hand, will be destroyed in every way it is possible to be destroyed-and even in some which are essentially impossible. Are you crazy? I am not going out in that! This must be a mistake. I got a standard relocation coupon, just like everybody else. Hit in the gut! Nice! [Gunship Explosion] No! Don't forget to reload, Dr. Freeman They're on our tail! [Suppressor Incoming] Barney? If you'd be so kind? Good job. You should be able to sneak through these vents. What are you doing? Better and better! Hey, uh, yeah. About that cat... But this stuff, it's all I have left... Dr. Kleiner, you have to stop them! [Button sound] The bridge we've gotta cross is beyond that gate. Over here! We must have hit a motherlode of soldiers. They're coming in from everywhere. Pick up the can. Headcrabs! *cheers* [Hissing gas jet] It's an antlion guard! You'll never guess who found his way into our lab this morning. Hurry up, Mossman! You sure about that? Time, Dr. Freeman? Dr. Freeman? Can you hear me? Do not go into the light! Judge those who do injustice to me; fight with those who fight with me. Your companionship is greatly belabored. we'll be going through. Spread the word. [Suppressor Launch] We used to be able to go right up there to Ravenholm. It was an old mining town inhabited by some escapees from City 17. Ahem. Alyx, why don't you take Gordon along and give him some practice with the gravity gun. *pain!* [Button sound] There is no rest in Ravenholm. Move on and I will meet you at the church! Dog, open the airlock. Get us out of here. Reload, Dr. Freeman! The Freeman can make use of this. [Dog Damaged] With you beside us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh. Reporting citizen summoned to voluntary conscription for general service public detail T94-322. The Citadel's on full alert! I've never seen it lit up like that. Excellent. range 8 meters And only the universal union that small minds call 'The Combine' can carry us there. Let me end your torment! [Train Crossing Bell] Well, brother... you have found another egress from the House of Chaos. Let us know where you want us, Dr. Freeman. We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us. Get off the road! I can't take it anymore. Oh, listen to me, I sound like a post-doc. I'm just so excited to think that we'll finally have the chance to work together. Thanks, but I'll be okay. Got some work to finish up here. Can we be of service? My God... we made it. Combat shotgun acquired. If anyone would have told me I'd be pals with a vortigaunt... [Wood breaking] Blast that little...where did she get to? Lamarr? Come out of there! [Button sound] Do what is right, Dr. Freeman. [Headcrab Alert] Never mind me. Save yourselves. Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of choosing for you...if and when your time comes round again. Watch out for the exhaust. Try to find cover from it. I'm not saying goodbye, Dad. We'll meet you there. Let's go! Good idea, Doctor Freeman. I'd come with you, but I've got to look after Dr. Kleiner. [Turret Deploy] [Mudskipper Engine Start] We're still not sure what that does. Alyx brings in the strangest things. Stay close, brother. HEV general failure! You smell that? It's freedom. For my soul is filled with evil, and like this place must be purged. This is unaccustomed Be careful now. [Cardboard breaking] You'd better run! There's nothing else you can do here! Here, I have a more suitable gun for you. You'll need it. You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers. And not a moment too soon. Something must be wrong with me, I almost understood that. Sorry. Take this medkit. Return to the void. Atmospheric contaminant sensors activated. That was a close call. Thanks for your help! [Klaxon] The coordinates, Dr. Mossman. Pass on! Sorry we took so long. I hope that wasn't too bad for you. Get down! Hey you, help yourself! Power restored ... 80 percent. Did you hear a cat just now? Cover me, Gordon. Warning. Hazardous radiation levels detected. [Barnacle Bite] Anyway, I should be in here working on the portal. Yes, we will vocalize in your auditory language as a matter of courtesy. Warning. Vital signs critical. Evacuate area. Gordon Freeman's here. I don't believe it. Done. I'll see you there, baby. Colonel Cubbage is in the basement, Doctor Freeman. Hold still. [Rollermine Retract] [Button sound] Over here. You gotta be damn hungry to wait in line for this crap. Great, I'll open this up. Dr. Freeman? We hoped for one more fighter to help storm that barricade, but we never guessed it would be you. Wow, nice shot! Gordon and Dog can head your way. I want to get Dr. Kleiner somewhere safer, then I'll meet up with you. [Dog Curious] Hey, thanks, Freeman. More soldiers are coming, Gordon. [Zap!] Inner shields are coming down. [Empty chamber] Oh, and before I forget. I think you dropped this back in Black Mesa. Stand clear. Help us! Hey, thanks. [Strider Death] When this is all over I'm...aw, who am I kidding? The bargain we should be making is for Eli's life, so he can continue his research! This is the Freeman. The Combine's reckoning has come. My leg! Keep on going and you'll see the car. Come! Look, Gordon, there's my dad. I'm going to bring him in. [Turret Alert] [Door Closed] Come on, Gordon, get in! Come on! Well, Gordon Freeman! And about time, too. When is it all going to end? I think he wants you to go through, Gordon. You'd better hurry. Good. Keep going. Oh, Judith... Doc, since he's not taking the streets, you might as well get him out of his civvies. We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nihilanth's demise. You leap, you fall, we see you flash beyond the barriers. Heads up! And now this one must bid the Freeman farewell. Nova Prospekt lies just beyond. Remember well what you have learned here. The Eli Vance has greatest confidence in you. Our life is worthless unless spent on freedom. Look at them down there. range 16 meters I have known Dr. Vance far longer than you, my dear. I'm afraid your feelings for him may have blinded you-- I need to get patched up. Go on. Find Barney! Enough of your bullshit! You'll make it through if anyone can. You're not the first to harbor such illusions Your mentors are partly to blame, of course. My disappointment in Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner is far greater than my sorrow over your unfortunate choice of career path. In a way, I suppose you could not have done otherwise. Who knows what seeds of iconoclasm they planted when you were young and gullible. But while they certainly share a great part of the responsibility for the recent troubles, it is you alone who have chosen to act with such willful disregard for humanity's future. [Falling Damage] [Antlion Guard Roar] [Rollermine Deploy] [Locked] [Radio Static] With you here, Dr. Freeman, we can finally make some headway. We have dreamed of this moment. Then let's go! [Suppressor Launch] There's no other receiver that could... Come on, Gordon. [Melon Splat] Oh, it's hardly the worst. But you might find that hard to believe once you get there. Come on. Get down! [Zombie Scream] Hi. *pain!* The time is now ... 3 PM Automatic target acquisition system activated. The feeling is mutual Don't listen to him, Gordon. [Gate Sound] Yeah! Good idea! Hold on a sec. Don't waste the hoppers, Dr. Freeman. We can use them against the Combine. [Turret Alarm] Help me! Once you've picked something up you can drop it gently by pressing your secondary trigger again. Yes! Onward to the mines! Woe to thee! *death* Nice! Power restored ... 20 percent. Oh, God! Turn not thy face away from me; incline thy ear and hear me when I shall cry to thee in my affliction. Warning. Electrical damage detected. Rollermines! Idle speculation This way, Dr. Freeman. That'll shut down the suppressor on the roof as well. It's not supposed to end like this. Hey, move it now, will you? *laughter* First warning: Move away. Civil Protection! Get your suit on, Gordon. Dr. Freeman? It's been a real honor. I'm looking forward to working together. Dr. Breen... Wallace... You talking to me? It's gonna go critical. Just a few more. [Combine Radio: Alert!] *laughter* They're hitting us with canisters! On our way. Ow! Quickly, brother! Go ahead, we'll talk later. All right, let me think. Think, Alyx, think! Sorry, Doc. Know what you mean. Be there in a second, Gordon. Be careful, Gordon, I'm picking up a lot of Combine sensors in the area ahead. Armour compromised. I've found it handy for clearing minefields. Just hurry, he's right behind me! Now, who's going to be the lucky one to carry it into combat? Really? Well, let's see how it serves you on the far side of a Combine portal. We don't...what are you...don't shoot...what are you doing...please, don't hurt me...please don't shoot...Don't shoot! Don't shoot! [Gunship Dying] [Strider Charge] [Door Pounding] Dr. Breen again? I was hoping I'd seen the last of him in City 14. [Can't Use] Good. Okay, Doc. You better hurry. You're not the man I thought you were. [Shattering ceramics] He's one of us. [Button sound] Is Lamarr with him? percent Don't tell me. Come here. I see they took your suitcase too! They can't get away with this much longer. Almost done. Stay with me, Freeman. How'd I miss that? The Freeman must beware! Shut it down, shut it down! Oh no! What's going on? Got one! Good idea. There's a charger on the wall. I've modified your suit to draw power from Combine energy outlets, which are plentiful wherever they patrol. Stash your car in the barn! The time is now ... 5 AM [Turret Alert] [Hard Impact] [Crane magnet release] [Turret Death] Eli, I was so worried about you! range 10 meters immediately I wish I knew. I'm encountering unexpected interference! I have the repairs well in hand. All right, good, you keep right on it. Get outta here. Where are you, Alyx? We have lost all dear to us. Never can tell. This shouldn't take too long. As soon as the generator's down, I'll open that gate and we can get out of here. Welcome to the lab anyway. It's not Black Mesa, but it's served us well enough. [Locked] Rest, my child. Where's your ball, Dog? range 11 meters First, let us consider the fact that for the first time ever, as a species, immortality is in our reach. Go on! Oh no. Now we're really gonna get it. Listen, I gotta go, Doc. We're taking enough chances as it is. *moan* All right, Barney. Your turn. That map is out of date, but you can still see more or less the route to Nova Prospekt. Can't vouch for the road, though. We've lost touch with some of the outposts. We see you still in Black Mesa. Clearly we see you in the Nihilanth's chamber. The vortigaunts relieved me so I could come see Gordon. Who the hell are you? Got it. What cat? Is somebody up there! Woe to all, for our dwelling place is distant, and we wander through the domiciles of Chaos. Come on, get in here. I'm not leaving you again, Eli. CPs! I think no worse of thee. So, this is Dr. Freeman, at last. I wish I could say this was a pleasant surprise, but it's neither a surprise nor, as you would surely agree, very pleasant. Well, I am nothing if not pragmatic. Power level is My gut! I've modified your suit to draw power from Combine energy outlets, which are plentiful wherever they patrol. Let's go! Throw it, Dog. Whoa...deja vu! Dad, hang on! 80 Okay! I wonder where he's going. I figured Alyx wouldn't want him getting any deeper in trouble, but... Hell, you try stopping him! [Begin Charging] Laszlo, don't move! [Engine stalled in water] I'll catch up with you as soon as I've got Dr. Kleiner settled. Run for your life! [Door Sound] The Freeman. Go, Gordon. [Button sound] Let's meet up at the horse! Come on, Gordon. Yes, indeed. We're ready to project you, Gordon. Bon voyage, and best of luck in your future endeavors! [Rollermine Damaged] Get going! [Antlion Attack] Please! Hey, you're Freeman, aren't you? The Freeman must not delay: Hurl that pheropod into the pit. [Locked] [Button sound] Gordon, the longer you delay, the greater the danger to us all. Oh my God. And you've been working with this thing? For how long? Get going! Then let's do it. Well, did it work? Warning! Make free use of my traps, but take care not to fall in them yourself. 30 I'm thinking, I'm thinking. The Freeman honors us. All right, Mossman, where are you...? range 6 meters Come on. Down you go. It's my work too! And I had to prove to Dr. Breen that your father would be the most valuable member of any research effort going forward from here. Thy will be done, Oh Light of Lights. I bless the glory of thy greatness all the day and through the darkness of this night. Now what? It crept forth boldly while its brethren remained in the blackest ocean abyss, with lidless eyes forever staring at the dark, ignorant and doomed despite their eternal vigilance. The Freeman is in our way. Insufficient medical supplies to repair damage. Patch him up and get him to the back as soon as he's stable. [Sonic Damage] Let's not allow it to come to that. I have done my best to convince our Benefactors that you are the finest the species has to offer. So far they have accepted my argument, but without concrete evidence to back it up, my words sound increasingly hollow even to me. The burden of proof is on you. As is the consequence of failure. I'll just leave it at that. Good God! That was close! Dog came crashing through the plaza, knocking over walls and...I think he's looking for Alyx. He seems to have it set in his head that she's in the Citadel. Careful there. [Lever sound] Watch out! Shouldn't we be doing something? Gordon and I were just there a minute ago. [Leech bites] You'd better get going. I can't look. This isn't the time. Hi. Take some ammo! More soldiers. Dog, go with Gordon. Remember: use the launcher's laser guide to steer your rocket past the gunship's defenses. Don't you worry. Right you are. MIT graduates are few and far between these days. We'll get you out of that hazard suit and back into your lab coat, where you belong. *scream* Therefore I say, yes, I am a collaborator. We must all collaborate, willingly, eagerly, if we expect to reap the benefits of unification. I have a bad feeling about this. What's the use? You can also pull stuff over from a distance. Be wise. Be safe. Be aware. Help me! [Headcrab Death] You, Citizen! Come with me. Go ahead, Gordon, we'll catch up with you later. Stand aside, brother! I'll have this open in a jiffy. Be careful! Experimental energy weapon acquired. Don't worry about the airboat. The Vort's gonna look after it for you. Get this thing open, Gordon. Civil Protection is on to us. I suspect you have little wish to remain in Ravenholm, so I will show you to the mines. Ah ghurrrr... [Zombie Attack] Over here! [Shattering monitor] Go on, Gordon! Internal bleeding detected. [Gunship Ping] Any last words, Doc? We have survived darker times. We will put aside Black Mesa... for now. Get in here, quick! It could take me a couple minutes to take control of the gate. We've got some ammo in those crates over there. Antidote administered. Come on, Gordon, build a stack and get up here. Internal bleeding detected. Don't rely on it. Wound sterilised. [Dog Growl] We trusted you! This'll do nicely. Rise, brother. Rise! Here they come. [Gun firing] Get going, Gordon! [Button Sound] Damn it! There is no distance between us. No false veil of time or space may intervene. We are you, Freeman. And you are us. We're done for. What's the password? Munition-level monitoring activated. It is all one in the plenitude Ah, Gordon Freeman. But where will you go? Keep it to yourself. One more bit and we're ready. The time is now 1 pm Keep your mind on your work. Hit in the gut! [Strider Minigun] Doctor Freeman? Gordon Freeman? Is that you? You've made it here this quickly? Well, Eli is going to be amazed. Not to mention relieved. Patience, brother! [Antlion Crunch] That's my girl. range 7 meters Uh...okay...oh ah oooh! What's she up to? Good call, Doc. Let's just see if this thing works, okay? If you dare say 'That's gotta hurt,' I'll kill you. Okay, Doc, you're in charge. Suspect, prepare to receive civil judgment. How about it, Dr. Freeman? I'm waiting for your signal, Doc. Look after my father. Hey down there! Supplies! We're going to need all the help we can get, dealing with the Nexus up ahead. The time is now ... 1 AM Come on, Gordon, let's go! [Dog Angry] Judith... I hope you said your farewells. Thank God. Good to know you. You're gonna be in trouble. Hold still, Laszlo! Someone's coming! Move it along! Good plan, Doc. Hurry while I hold the gate! *moan* Self propelled grenade acquired. Indeed it is. And it's our intention to send him packing straightaway, in the company of your lovely daughter. With pleasure. God damn you, Breen! You let her go! I will end your torment! range 18 meters Remote activated demolition unit acquired. Run! *pain!* Oh, fie! It'll be another week before I can coax her out of there. Wait for me, Dr. Freeman. I'll come with you. That almost made sense. [Button sound] My leg! I'll start working on this gate. Just a sec. [Button sound] Was that you knocking? I didn't even know we still had a door. They're coming down. ...about that beer I owed ya. Warning. Vital signs critical. Gordon, take out these snipers, would ya?! There's a command center downstairs. I'm hoping to find information about generator locations. Gong... range 19 meters [Grenade Explosion!] If you can hold them off, I'm almost done here. Somebody take his crowbar. Dr. Freeman! Barney said you were on the way. We got split up by snipers, and he's pinned down in a warehouse up ahead. Go ahead. He's relying on you. Uh oh. Dropships! I can't take any credit for the breakthrough, Doctor. I don't dream anymore. What's the meaning of this? [Mine De-activated] Instinct tells us that the unknown is a threat, rather than an opportunity. Hey, stop that. The vorts are on our side now. Let's get going. The suppressor's down, so you can get to the roof now. Ready when you are. Oh, Mother... If you see this so-called Free Man, report him. Minor fracture detected. This way. I'll hold 'em off. You'd better get going. [Turret Retract] [Door Sound] [Door Sound] Go on through, Gordon. Oh, dear! Never, until now. I did have a fairly good idea of what to expect... Dropship! Over the field! Thank you for writing, Concerned. Of course your question touches on one of the basic biological impulses, with all its associated hopes and fears for the future of the species. Hey, get out of the way! We just lost Gordon! What's going on? See for yourself. Good. I want you two to... Gah! N.L.O. to Lighthouse Point. N.L.O. to Lighthouse Point. Come in. This is Colonel Cubbage. Come in, please. Let me read a letter I recently received. 'Dear Dr. Breen. Why has the Combine seen fit to suppress our reproductive cycle? Sincerely, A Concerned Citizen.' We'll never have a chance like this again. We've got to stop Dr. Breen. We're with you, Dr. Freeman. Let us know if we can do anything extra to help. It is an honor. Hello? Stock up! Get it off him! Get it off! The worst she might do is attempt to couple with your head. Fruitlessly. Our finest poet describes it thus: Gallum galla gilla ma. Overwatch stopped our train in the woods and took my husband for questioning. They said he'd be on the next train. I'm not sure when that was. They're being nice, though, letting me wait for him. *Combine Soldier Death* In Ravenholm, you do well to be vigilant. Dog, throw something bigger. I've gotta get back on my shift, but okay. That door's locked from the other side, Dr. Freeman. Maybe you can find a way around. Oh no, don't worry about me honey. Wait for us! [Turret Dies] [Door Sound] [Gate Sound] Here they come. Strider! Take care of yourself out there. [Manhack Death] Let's get across. He's coming through, Dad. It's safer here. Cover me. [Suppressor Impact!] Over here, brother. Ugh! And you've been working with this thing? For how long? No argument there. Oh no, Combine soldiers. Where did they come from? Great, another security station. *pain!* *screaming* You'd better reload. Get in the basement! We're making sure everyone has what they need to hold off an attack. Major lacerations detected. [Gun charging] Gordon, go right ahead. [Shattering Glass] Yes, Gordon, please do go on. Sounds like they're calling in every CP unit in City 17. Incoming! Dropship at the lighthouse! Automatic target acquisition system deactivated. We're here to get you out, Dad. We are there still, in observance of your final stroke. Barnacles! Should I take that personally? Your bright face obscures your darker mask. Oh, fiddlesticks. What now? Riiit... No, stop! What are you doing? They're on the roof! Scanners! [Concrete Breaking] You would have had Freeman if you'd been patient and just waited for my signal. [Wood splintering] All right, here goes. We are a tapestry woven of vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it. Cover me while I reload! You going to let Gordon throw the switch? That's it. *laughter* Watch out! Help me! Okay. Barney should be on the far side of that... canal. Watch out for antlions. Instinct coddled us and kept us safe in those hardscrabble years when we hardened our sticks and cooked our first meals above a meager fire I'm glad there's no kids around to see this [Secondary Fire] [Creak!] Dog, take Gordon to the Ravenholm tunnel, then circle around and try to meet up with me. Hurry! Is it the Freeman? Help! We cannot read the Freeman's optical buds. *pain!* Unidentified bio weapon. *moan* Gordon... [Locked] Get in your car and I'll open up this gate. Station 8, do you copy? Station 8, are you there? We have confirmed reports of manhacks. Repeat: they're filling the underground with manhacks. It's your pet, the freakin' head-humper! Assent. [Empty chamber] Now... No! Okay, that's it! Our cause seems hopeless. Power restored ... 25 percent. Pick up that can. [Door Sound] 4 Yes, Judith, what is it? [Headcrab Death] in the Citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors. Damn! Ew! Headcrabs! *pain!* Let me just finish up some work and I'll see what I can dig up. Gordon, run! Get out of here! Defensive weapon selection system activated. *pain!* Blood plasma administered. The Freeman must not proceed without the tau particle cannon! Check out those shield generators. I've got nothing to deal with those. What we need here is some kind of action at a distance. Civic deeds do not go unrewarded. And contrariwise, complicity with his cause will not go unpunished. Careful, brother! Well done, brother! You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure. We've gotta get the skybridge open. No, not up there! Agh! Hurry up, Dr. Freeman. Serve mankind. [Belltone] Look there. This isn't a good time. [Zombie Pain] Get back here! Dad! For Freedom! Look, we're just the lookout for the underground railroad. [Deny] Hurrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Churrrrrrrrrrr---Koff! Hack! Wheeze! [Strider Alert] Gordon Freeman? Well now we're getting somewhere. Alyx, it's Leon, and I've got Gordon Freeman with me. [Headcrab Burning] Get going, Dr. Freeman. Nova Prospekt is just ahead. One man alone wouldn't stand much chance going in there, but a man with a pack of antlions... well, that's a different story. Where are you taking me? To our honor we follow you. Clear for now. Ah, there you are! At last! The time is now ... 4 PM Little help here, Gordon? [Turret Firing] [Lever sound] Alyx and Gordon have just arrived. He's done this before. He'll be okay. It's good to see ya, Gordon. It'll be good to have your help goin' into the nexus up ahead. Overwatch! [Door Sound] And that day of transformation, I have it on good authority, is close at hand. Go ahead. I hope you have better luck than we had. No, I'm good. I have been asked to say a few words to the transhuman arm of Sector Seventeen Overwatch, concerning recent successes in containing members of the resistance Science Team. Let's get a move on! We've got to clear out before they target us. Help! He's on the way. Let's go meet him. acquired You're pushin' it Gordon. Here come the hacks! Ah, hello! I'll be right with you! I haven't lost my touch! That's all up to you, my old friend. Hurry up! You're not the man I thought you were. [Ammocase close] [Explosion!] Civil Protection! It's Freeman, he's here! Let us out, we'll throw in with you. Likewise, we are sure. Here they come! Sorry, Doc. [Tower Creaking!] Go on, get going! [Button sound] Oh my God. This is the Citadel's dark fusion reactor. It powers their tunneling entanglement device. Power restored ... 90 percent. [Medkit Pickup] In our current unparalleled enterprise, refusal to collaborate is simply a refusal to grow--an insistence on suicide, if you will. Well, end of the line. That's not Freeman is it? How did you get in here? Who's hurt? *laughter* Noriko, bring the buggy out, put it on the dock right now. Gordon Freeman will be driving it! Mend your ways, before it is too late! *pain!* [Stopping Antlion Repeller] [Gunship Damaged] Okay, the core's exposed. We got word you were coming. Hello? Thank God someone... Alyx? Gordon! How did you get in here? Here it comes! Ohh! [Wood straining] Uh, Doctor? The plug? Okay, Doc. What now? [Door Sound] [Camera Deploy] [Glass shattering] Open the gate! We follow the Freeman. Good luck in Nova Prospekt, Dr. Freeman. Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow. Barnacles Okay let's go. Follow me. Here we go! We're not leaving here without you. That's final. Oh, Gordon! The vortigaunts said you were here! I can't believe you made it so quickly on foot. [Empty] Can't you see I'm busy? Alyx, whatever you may think, I assure you I've worked to protect your father. Hurry, get in the basement. We're expecting gunships at any moment. Colonel Cubbage will be glad to see you made it. We dedicate ourselves to your purpose. Have you ever had an original thought? Here they come! Good idea, Doc. Come in, Odessa...do you read? Taaar... *moan* 20 Lend a hand, brother! Feelings? This has nothing to do with feelings. It's a simple truth that when Eli believes in our--- Great Scott! Gordon Freeman! I expected more warning. I got one! Instinct was our mother when we were an infant species. You idiot! Walking on the sand brings antlions after you! You're going down! Meanwhile, let my vortigaunt friend here give you a jolt to get you going. Just enter the coordinates for Dr. Kleiner's lab and let's get moving. They have thrown a switch and exorcised our demons in a single stroke. Clear, no 647, no 10-107. This is the gravity gun my father was talking about. You can call it the 'Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator' if you really want to. Come on in. Behind you! Oh no! Okay, this is it. You take that door. I'll take this one. Run! Ow! No more! They're right outside, get going! Get over here! But who is this? Another life to save? You see? We're working to the same end. I've already reprogrammed the modulator to emulate a Xen relay. 9 millimeter semi-automatic hand gun. [Manhack Deploy] Gordon Get out of City 17 as fast as you can, Gordon! Take the old canals, right? They'll get you to Eli's lab. It's a dangerous route, but there's a whole network of refugees and they'll help you if they can. Dibs on the suit. Damn it! This body is yours to command. Use the gravity gun, Gordon. Out there! Follow, Freeman. Quick, get these set up. I'm seeing soldiers in all directions. Gordon! Meet me over there! [Button sound] Keep those turrets set up. Gordon! I had a feeling I'd find you here. Stop! We didn't do anything! [Splash!] So much for stealth. We've been spotted! I thought he was invincible! My power was lost in places which were not mine. Affliction besought me, and the merciless ones attacked me without cause. Hey, remember when we thought Black Mesa was as bad as it could get? Here they come! Oh shit! Help me! *pain!* [Wood breaking] Don't drink the water. They put something in it to make you forget. I don't even remember how I got here. Good. We'll send my dad through first. He's in position for... The portal destination is untenable. Surely you can set the relay elsewhere. There's no way I can survive in that environment. [Wood Breaking] Scanners! Go on! [Mine Hop] That's the old passage to Ravenholm. We don't go there anymore. Good enough. This is how it always starts. First a building, then the whole block. Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share. Tear it apart if you have to! Just get it open! Get your car off the road! Major lacerations detected. I'm not sure, it seems to be some kind of interference. *Moan!* We believe the opposite No turning back now. Dear God! Poor Laszlo! The finest mind of his generation, come to such an end. Antitoxin administered. Warning. Hazardous radiation levels detected. 100 percent. I'm sticking here. Oh God! More soldiers are coming. Make sure to keep those turrets up to help defend. Here they come! You found Eli? Help me! [Button sound] 60 The hand-brake, brother! Release it and come down! I'm fine, but you! You've got to get out of here! Insufficient medical supplies to repair damage. [SMG Primary Fire] Is Gordon still with you? Try using the hoppers against 'em. Look, it isn't safe here. I'll give you some supplies to keep you going, then you really gotta go. [Engine start] The time is now ... 10 PM I have a failure to comply with loyalty check, possible 10-103M. Go on now. Welcome. Welcome to City 17. Sorry to take so long, Gordon. Looks like you could have used some help. I won't leave you again though. Now let's track down Mossman. Dr. Mossman... That's you all over. Gas giants inhabited by vast meteorological intelligences. Worlds stretched thin across the membranes where dimensions [Enemy Gunfire] So much for our last hope. We serve the same mystery. [Gaspump Ignites] The time is now ... 8 AM Great! Oh no. Breen's started his ascent. Good. Now, get the skybridge connected. [Train horn!] We thought you were here to help. Yeah! You did it! Look out below! Iniquity's snares are cunning, but by the Light of Lights, mine are greater still. [Elevator Ready] Time remaining ... 30 seconds. I'm hurt! [Antlion Emerging] I can't remember the last time I had a shower. Lead on, Freeman! Colonel Odessa Cubbage at your service! The time is now ... 4 AM [Burning] Judith? What do you think you're doing? Warning. Vital signs dropping. Until we meet again [Battery Pickup] Sure thing. [Parasite Thrown] Come on, Gordon! Go on! Go on, Gordon, give the core a jolt. For it was said they had become like those peculiar demons, which dwell in matter but in whom no light may be found. Fantastic! I believe he broke your record, honey. We've figured out how to use Xen as an unexpressed axis, effectively a dimensional slingshot, so we can swing around the borderworld and come back in local space without having to pass through. [SMG Grenade Launch] *pain!* Here goes. My Goodness! Gordon Freeman! It really is you, isn't it? I've been working undercover with Civil Protection. I can't take too long or they'll get suspicious. I'm way behind on my beating quota. [Barnacle Bonebreak] 05 Yet Eli refuses to speak the words that would save them all. According to the vortigaunts, he is a prisoner at the Citadel. We owe a great deal to Dr. Freeman, even if trouble does tend to follow in his wake. *chuckle* [Button sound] Ah! Right on. No! No, boy! Down! Put that down! Let me say up front that I regret having to temper my heartfelt congratulations with a strong measure of disappointment. But I wouldn't be doing my duty as your Administrator if I didn't pass along the message I have received from our Benefactors. You've done so well, in fact, that I've received some interesting offers for your services. Ordinarily, I wouldn't contemplate them. But these are extraordinary times. What's that? Hold on. Gotta bring this back down. Pointless of you. Move along. Looks like instead of going over it Awesome. 70 [Mudskipper Engine Stop] 9 milimetre ammunition acquired. Get that car upright and get the hell out of here! Psst! Hey you! In here! Come on in. I'll show you what you're up against. All in a day's work, right? [Button sound] Finally! It was just a matter of time! Bouncebombs! Over here. Out there! Undeserving of consciousness. There's an old building up ahead, a bank or museum or something like that. Whatever the hell it used to be, now it's a nexus for Overwatch in City Seventeen. It's the main source of pain for this part of town, thanks to a huge suppression device that's raining down hell from the roof of the place. 15 Duck! Roger that. I won't hold it against you. Do your worst Gordon... but... be careful. But what about my father? Remember the turrets, Gordon. Looks to me like things are getting worse, not better. I'm picking up incoming soldiers. Here, I'll show you on this monitor. The primary trigger emits a charge. You can punt stuff and send it flying. Such pessimism will doom us all. Remember to stay off the sand. The antlions are edgy right now. [Bugbait Squeak] We surge. Run for your life! Go on Gordon, go with Alyx. Poor bastard doesn't stand a chance. HEV - damage sustained. 44 calibre ammunition acquired. They saw us! Power restored ... 40 percent. Initializing in three...two...one... Oh, fiddlesticks! What now? Headcrabs! I can't be seen talking to you. Not out here. [.357 Shot] The Freeman has done well. [Train Horn] Were you the only ones on that train? I'm not a betting man, but the odds are not good. [Pounding!] No! [Unlocked] Forget about that thing! Go on, I'll hold 'em. To the void with you. If Dr. Kleiner says you should wear that thing, you should wear it. Ware! Help me out. You've done a great deal in a small timespan. [Drawbridge stops] I was afraid we might not make it either. Come on through, Freeman. And hurry. Eli, look who I found in the airlock. We have to get across this canal! Help me! Wait a minute Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity. No matter the consequences of this struggle. [Locked] They're shelling us! Hurry, get your car in the barn! We're doing what I could never do alone. We're stopping you. I'm pretty sure this isn't part of the plan. Hmm. I require your assistance, brother! Stop that! we couldn't be any worse off. [Shattering Glass] Prepare for judgment! The Freeman will now be instructed in the use of pheropods. Sure thing, Gordon. Power restored ... 70 percent. This is where I get off. We'll have to get in that building to open the gate. Even then, the suppression device will suppress anyone coming through unless we shut it down. Ahem. Let's get a move on. All clear. Hey, everybody, follow Freeman! Gunship! [Headcrab Alert] Freeman, if you've got a launcher, the lighthouse is full of rockets. Power restored ... 45 percent. Man, that's good news! Yeah, that's better. Don't struggle, honey. [Hunter-Chopper Alarm] Watch it, will ya? [Fuzz] Instinct would inflict a fatal injury on our species. It's a gunship! We wish you were right Automatic target acquisition system activated. There's no time, Alyx. He's on his way to the portal. [Tram stop] Stop looking at me like that. Here. Another dropship! Oh, Dr. Freeman! You should stay with Eli. Go on, I'll rejoin you shortly. You're gonna have to ditch the car, Freeman. They're looking for it now. I'd like to take a moment to address you directly, Dr. Freeman. There we go. You can come through now. It cannot have gone unnoticed by all resistance members that Doctor Vance's capture coincided with the act of giving shelter to Gordon Freeman. This might cause other resistance members to think twice before harboring Doctor Freeman. It might cause them to question his allegiance; even prompt some to turn him out, or turn him over to our cause. Careful, Freeman! That's more information than I require. Don't sit near me. It'll look suspicious. So the neuroprints are true. See if you can find a weakness in those plates. We'll have to expose the core if we plan to destabilize it. [Door Sound] Funny, you showing up on this day in particular. The grenades, Gordon! There she is. Leave the talking to me Gordon. Are you ready for us, Dad? We'd better hurry. The Combine can be slow to wake, but once they're up, you don't want to get in their way. *pain!* To our glorious end. I'll take you to down Eli right away. He would never forgive me if I kept you waiting. From the voice of my groaning my bone has cleaved to my flesh. Good work. Watch your turrets. Do I know you from somewhere? Okay, Gordon, now you throw something to Dog and let him catch. That one shall trouble us no more. All right. Automatic medical systems engaged. No! [Charged secondary fire] I said move! Alyx? Gordon? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be talking behind her back. It just gets a bit claustrophobic down here. Okay, I don't blame you for hesitating, but if we're gonna do this thing, then let's just get through it. Power restored ... 75 percent. Try stacking some things. Grab something with your secondary trigger, then press the same trigger again to drop it gently. What's this? Oh, put it over there. No... Help ensure that humanity's trust in you is not misguided Shut up and be glad you're still some use to us! Help me! My arm! They're definitely coming in here! Well, Gordon, I see your HEV suit still fits you like a glove. At least the glove parts do. Do not go through Rav--- [Button Sound] Look out, Freeman Take this medkit. Okay, Doc, before you hit the road, you might want to grab some medkits, restock on ammo, maybe check the map and see where you're headed. There's an ammo supply crate on the back of the car, if that's any comfort. We should thank our benefactors for giving us respite from this overpowering force. Follow me, brother. And tread lightly. For this is hallowed ground. That damn thing haunts me. I thought so much of City 17 that I elected to establish my Administration here The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. Gordon Freeman? It is you, isn't it? Give me a minute, I'm gonna plant some charges and blow this open. We shall share the vortessence. Eli thinks their portals are string-based, similar to our Calabi-Yau model, but they've failed to factor in dark energy equations. They can tunnel through from their universe, but once they're here they're dependent on local transportation. If they knew what we're doing with entanglement--- Over there! [Hunter-Chopper Bombing Alert] Stop who, my dear? You'd better reload. Ah, we're losing him again! So there, you see? Possible bio reading. It's all clear, thanks to Gordon. Wow, nice shot! Back up! Final sequence. I almost hit you. Don't forget to charge up your suit. 6 Uh, there. This can't be! Power below No! Help! You never know. [Plastic breaking] Boy am I glad to see you. Agh! Agh! The soldiers were a bit overzealous, I admit, but he was too tempting a prize to simply turn loose, especially in the absence of Gordon Freeman. You can't just wade into the field, it will peel you apart! Farewell! And please tell Dr. Vance that Colonel Cubbage regrets not having been able to rescue him in person! 44 calibre handgun acquired. *laughter* Doctor, please... How are you doing that?! All right. Over here. You go on! I'm sorry, Alyx. It's the only way! Okay, Gordon, I'm going to leave off here and catch up with you. Be there as soon as I can. What cat? I'm picking up more incoming soldiers! See if there are some more turrets nearby! Here, brother! Get some turrets set up! [Double Shotgun Blast!] Let's go! You'd better get going now. Get in the airboat, sir. Get down! Good god! [Turret Ping] There we go. [Sprint Depleted] Here they come! We may need her to get out of here. Your mind is opaque. Overwatch! [Melon Splat] Ah, it is you, brother! I apologize! But no harm done. My bullets are the least of your concerns. What the hell? We are pleased that the Eli Vance thinks so highly of the Freeman. Nice catch There's the bridge [Barnacle Digestion] We've got a launch. We've got a launch! Yeah, I'm gonna need me some privacy for this! That is all for now. Get moving! It'll take me a few minutes to expose the core. Oh Light, may thy name be spoken in the graves, and spelled in bones and ashes! Hurry up. We cannot fire without harm to the Freeman. [CRASH!] *pain!* Return to your true nature. Bring your car up here and I'll open the gate for you. Get ready... Get going! Comes a man? It is! The Freeman! My god... how did you get here? And when? Dad, it's Alyx, do you read? Follow me. [Reloading] You mean it's working? For real this time? Because I still have nightmares about that cat. We're almost to the Citadel wall, Doc. I don't know how the hell we're going to breach it, but you've made it this far. I'm sure you'll think of something. Scanners! Look out! The Freeman must move. Very good. Final sequence. Commencing...now. [Strider Footsteps] Come on, Gordon, we don't have time to fool around. Get your suit on. [Shattering Glass] Damn it! Get it off me! Doctor Freeman? We're coming with you. [Sproing!] [Dog Pounding Ground] Gordon, we haven't known each other very long, but I know you didn't have to do this. I had to rescue my father, but you... well... Thanks for coming after me. You lead the way. [Shattering Glass] What now? Hey, look at the grenades, would ya? I can't shut down those fields from here, I'm going to have to catch up with you to get access to them. This one isn't connected to the net. I can't turn it off. There must be controls for it nearby. We have scarcely begun to climb from the dark pit of our species' evolution. Let us not slide backward into oblivion, just as we have finally begun to see the light. [EMP Device Burst] [Rattle-rattle!] Freeman, beware! Hey, sorry for the scare. I had to put on a show for the cameras. range 2 meters Follow me. He didn't come through. Hoppers! This doesn't look good. Careful! It seems as if you only just arrived. Hey, listen. No! Get going, Doc. We've gotta break camp. We will help you. [Dog Pounding Ground] Don't worry about me, sweetheart. Judith! I see they set you free! Charge up your suit first. Damn! It's jammed. Okay, I've got an idea. Head back to that office. Catch! *moan* Oh, I thought you were a cop. Okay, Gordon you're gonna have to make your own way to Dr. Kleiner's lab. [Bunker Siren] Dr. Freeman? If you were looking for a place to hole up, it's not safe here anymore. They're shelling the hell out of us. Here we come. Well, Dr. Freeman, under other circumstances I like to think we might have been able to work together in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Certainly, judging from your brief tenure at Black Mesa while I was its Administrator, you showed every promise of becoming a valuable and productive contributor to the scientific process. And yet... I'm not sure what spurred you to it... but there is really no place in this enterprise for a rogue physicist. We deem this company inviolable. [Combine Radio: Grenade Alert!] Into the airlock! Now! Heads up! For the days of my life have vanished like smoke, and my bones are parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as fuel for that fire until nothing remains but the Light alone. It has come to my attention that some have lately called me a collaborator, as if such a term were shameful. This is Station 8! We heard 12 go down and out. Surgical strike units are targeting railway stations. Repeat, Civil Protection is coming down on underground stations. We're already getting refugees from 9 and outlying! Looks like we're-- Is it really that time again? I swear by the pheropods myself. This marks a turning point. Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman. Rise and shine. Take some ammo! Combine! May they become like dust before the wind; may the angel of the Lord pursue them. One generator to go. But we need access to the teleport platform, and we're locked out. Warning: Hazardous radiation levels detected. The Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator is not a toy, Alyx! Get away from there! That's him. Thanks to you, we have everything we need in that regard. We trusted you. Oh no. Gordon! [Locked] Try not to dwell on it. Here boy, Dog! come back here, Dog! I don't think this war's ever gonna end. Hold onto that launcher, Dr. Freeman. You'll be glad you have it on the road ahead. Whatever you say. Go on, Gordon, I'll take care of this. You made it just in time. We've got to clear out of here before we're discovered. Help! Over here! *pain!* Greetings to the Freeman. We can't continue until you're in the teleport chamber, Gordon. Look out! Quick, search the room. There should be some Combine turrets nearby. Certainly. Incoming! [Ichthyosaur Roar] Freeman is...dead... Will you let your stubborn short-sightedness doom the entire species, or Get in the elevator and I'll let you in. Gordon, you made it! Run! I need help, brother! You coming? [Beep-beep-beeeeeeeeep.] User Fatality. If you can get those hoppers up without setting them off, you can plant them wherever you want them. [Train wheels screeching!] Automatic Medical Kit. Let's head for the roof now, Gordon. [Manhack Engine] Automatic medical systems engaged. [Rock Thud] Barney has been leading a push with that very aim in mind. And yet unsophisticated minds continue to imbue him with romantic power, giving him such dangerous poetic labels as the One Free Man, the Opener of the Way. Roll a grenade in there if you've got one. That oughtta do it. Power restored ... 10 percent. Major fracture detected. HEV Power Unit acquired. Look out! Keep your turrets set up. You've got to hold on til I get there. It's Leon. We're all clear. And I've got Gordon Freeman! [Sniper Alert] Warning: Vital signs critical. Evacuate area. Armour compromised. Here. Let me buy you a drink. [Breaking wood] A host body? You must be joking, I can't possibly--- Oh shit! Some day this will all be a bad memory. Come out, Lamarr! Dr. Freeman? You're kidding. I've been on the line with Alyx. Her father's been captured. We have a 10-108! I talked to Dr. Kleiner I said, get back up on the pier. But getting there, with that hunter-chopper on your ass, next to impossible. Lamarr? Lamarr! Hey, Leon. Do you still have the car my Dad and I put together? Hit the road, Jack! Warning. Blood toxin levels detected. Good luck out there, Gordon. Antitoxin administered. [Wood straining] Welcome to the HEV Mark 4 Protective System, for use in hazardous environment conditions. Follow me. Hey, Dr. Freeman, I've been hoping you'd show up. Got this airboat all gassed up and ready to go. They come! I can't be seen talking to you. It's too late! Stand back! [Antlion Burrowing] They know you betrayed them. They'll turn on you! Judith -- Dr. Mossman. Please! Get your car in there! [Wall Crashing!] I almost gave you guys up for lost! Couldn't have put it better myself. Power restored ... 30 percent. Over here! The Freeman must retrieve the fallen pheropods without delay! He's there? So, here we are. The scrapyard. There's nothing Gordon can't handle... with the possible exception of you. [Scanner Divebomb] Manhacks! [Lever sound] The secondary trigger lets you grab things. You can throw them with the primary. Yes, my children, it is I! [Button locked] Careful, Freeman! They're never gonna make a stalker out of me. Farewell, Dr. Freeman. Follow me. We were heading to the vortigaunt camp, hoping to pick up some bugbait so these damn things would leave us alone. But without Laszlo what's the point? Damn it, not again! We were looking to join you, Doctor Freeman. The Freeman must squeeze his bug-bait sharply if he wishes the antlions to follow where he leads. Oh, do be careful. [Incoming Mortar] Okay, last charge! We'll think of something. [Camera Alert] We live to serve. I don't understand. Oh man, that's what I was afraid of. Get in here, Gordon, before you blow my cover. Affirmed. It is the Freeman. Ha! Got you now. Stop toying with that! Evacuate area. Let's do it. Alyx is around here somewhere. She would have a better idea how to get him here. Now, to find my father. Vital signs are dropping. The Freeman must follow. Set some traps for them, Gordon. Okay, it's human. At the moment, I fear they have begun to look upon even me with suspicion. So much for serving as humanity's representative. Ware, Freeman! [Headcrab Digging] We can't keep him here long, Doc. It'll jeopardize everything we've worked for. Hmm. [Locked] Sure... Come on, Gordon. Let's go have some fun. No thanks to you. Fragmentation grenage acquired. Need any help with this one? No! No! Yeah! Power restored ... 50 percent. Good plan. It's going to be a lot more like Black Mesa with Gordon here to help. Stop it, Freeman! Go quickly! He came a long way from Black Mesa. Dad, I'm so sorry. Ammunition Depleted. Overwatch! So, wake up, Mr. Freeman. Wake up and smell the ashes. [Gate Sound] You'll need this. First model was about yay-high. I've been adding to him ever since. Haven't I, boy? Time remaining ... 10 seconds. *laughter* Wound sterilized. Morphine administered. [Manhack Engine] Instinct creates its own oppressors, and bids us rise up against them. Hop in and I'll lower you down to the beach. Will you get going? [Reloading] They have given us purpose. They have turned our eyes toward the stars. There you are! Uh-oh. I'm gonna stay here and keep these gates open long enough to make a difference. Okay, I'm ready. [Turret Death] [Flaregun fired] Gordon, you need to get out of here. Caution! Gordon Freeman! Let me get a look at you, man! My God, you haven't changed one iota! How do you do it? One for me and one for me. His portal was almost working again. Yes! Ha! 40 For it was said they had become like those peculiar demons, which dwell in matter but in whom no light may be found. As for me... A shepherd must tend to his flock. Especially when they have grown unruly. I couldn't have asked for a finer volunteer! [Gutterpipe rattling] Here, have a medkit. [Crash!] The bridge! Damn tiddly-winks! I pray do never turn away thy light. Give heed to me, and spring thy traps upon my enemies when I cry out to thee. Do you feel it? I feel it! [Bunker Siren] [Button sound] Grenade! I've got to stay here in case anyone else needs to get across. I'll take all the help I can get. Hey, Doc. Get back! Sorry, Freeman. I'm encountering unexpected interference. Maybe we can hook up later. Keep those turrets set up. Help! Come on! Let's get going. Look out! Doctor Freeman, I presume? Better get going, Gordon. Hurry, Gordon, before he escapes. Now, where was I? Ah, yes... Hey, come on! Oh my god! What coordinates are these? Where the hell did she take him? How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again. Put that down! Good God. Come on, hurry! Keep moving, Dr. Freeman. I'll send word you're coming, and see you up ahead. Pick up some stuff and toss it. Careful. Hey! Let us through! I can hear you in there! Come on! Open the door! It won't be much longer now, Dr. Freeman. The time is now ... 9 AM Doesn't anyone care what I think? I'm looking for the light switch now. Could we talk about this later? Come here. You're quite the returning hero these days, Gordon. Save them? For what? Wait for me here. Here's where you come in, Gordon. I need you to make your way along the coast until you get to Nova Prospekt. It used to be a high security prison-it's something much worse than that now. But I think it's still easier to sneak in than to break out. You'll need to use the gravity gun. [Splat!] Let me get out of your way No! There he is! Go back, Freeman, you have no idea what you're doing! Well, Gordon Freeman! And about time, too. What a waste. Okay, Gordon, let's try something else. So this is the Combine portal. It's smaller than I imagined. Guess those sirens are for you, huh? Wouldn't be the first time. [Distant Zombie Alert] Let's get going! Hurry! You are to be commended for avoiding my traps. The work of a man who once had too much time on his hands, and now finds time for nothing but the work of salvation. It isn't necessary! Power level is ... 100 percent. None of your vort philosophy. Aim for the head! [Grenade rolling!] Warning. Hazardous chemical detected. [Siren] [Breathing...] *pain* Dr. Freeman. The Freeman again excels at all tasks! Ah! Hurl your bug-bait hard against the dummy. Return to the all in one. Alyx, really. Sometimes I think you deliberately misunderstand me. The man I saw, I'm all but certain it was... You shouldn't be walking around out here. Get into the basement. Well, I'll be damned. All right, I'm opening the gate. Medical damage repaired. Stay back, you'll attract unwanted attention. Yes, come to me! Come! Tourniquette applied. Bleeding has stopped. It's me you should be concerned about! I can still deliver Earth, but not without your help. [Low Ammunition Warning!] I'll meet up with you later. Bye, Alyx. The Combine will pay in kind for their depravity. [Explosion] No! Unidentified bio weapon. Gordon! Grenades! Go with Alyx, Gordon. She'll look after you. Allow us to recharge your cells. range 15 meters Here, patch yourself up. [Siren!] [Antlion Guard Angry] Get outta here! May the Light of Lights be with you. In the meantime, watch my back. Hey, over here! [Enemy Warning] Thanks, Doc. [Tau Cannon Jolt!] It looks like you're falling behind. I could never have predicted that. You should hear her drone on about how it should have been her in the Black Mesa Test Chamber that day. [Ma-ma!] For the dead know no sleep in their graves, nor dost thou remember them, until they are destroyed through thy hands. I've got my little corner and I'm sticking to it Help! It's a manhack! That's better. I thought it was all over for me. [Button sound] Glad to see you're okay. Damn it! Move back, Mossman, we're coming in. Well, we're in luck. There's a generator in the square outside. We're trying to disable as many as we can to loosen the Combine's grip on this sector. [Tram start] We could certainly use the extra help around here. The Eli Vance has earned our trust. First bit's done. [Motor stops] Me?! Gee, thanks. Good. Let's go. You'd better get going now! Oh, thank goodness. My relief is almost palpable. You need me! Dr. Freeman! The Combine has cut our supply tunnel in two. If you'll join up with us, we'll take a stab at pushing through their outpost. Dog! You made it! This'll get me into their security system. Gordon, get the gravity gun. *moan* If you're looking for a place to stay, you better keep going. Someone misjudged the capacity of the Combine thyristor--- We are standing by. Don't worry, Dad, we'll find her. For now, I'm going to send you to the teleport chamber. [Hunter-Chopper Flyby] Gordon! Right you are! Speak to you again in a few moments. We used to be able to go right up there to Ravenholm. It was an old mining town inhabited by some escapees from City 17. Wait a minute... Warning: Vital signs critical. All right, Dr. Freeman, come with me. Before another one comes. Why are you telling me? [Fast Geiger tick] I think I ate something bad. The way ahead is dark for the moment. Get going, Dr. Freeman. I can see Eli was right about you. Woe betide thee, child! I can't believe this day has finally come. This is no time to be wandering around. The Combine's closing in. Power restored. Let's go ahead and bring Gordon through now. You can place objects by moving them into position and hitting the secondary trigger again. Move it. That is all we can spare. Careful, Gordon. Now, now, she's around here someplace. I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition, Dr. Freeman. I trust it will all make sense to you in the course of...well... Energy recharge unit acquired. Whoops! Behind you! I'm hurt! Dropship! By the barn! Satisfaction. It's right there, Gordon. Doctor Mossman's waiting for you. Well met, Freeman. Gordon, as soon as you're in position, we'll send you to Eli's. Communion of the vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself. I could eat a horse, hooves and all. You'll have to forgive the scanning process. We can't take any chances. [Hunter-Chopper Pursuit] Okay, Doc, we're locked on. Look what I found. Help! Help me! We thought we'd be safer down here. Little did we know the place was infested. Rest of 'em headed upstairs, took their chances with the snipers. I guess they're still up there. Don't listen to him, Gordon. Get back! [Door Sound] Ow! You meant no harm. [Slicer stop] Well, brother, if I survive this night, I shall build you an honest pyre. Like them apples? Accept a charge. Possible Bio-reading. Your concern is touching The Hacks! To the roof, Gordon! Go ahead, Breen, if that's the worst you can do, send us both through your portal! Head back to that office, Gordon. Help! Judith - Dr. Mossman - please... Gordon! You must get out of here! Run! No, no! Careful, Lamarr! Those are quite fragile! Headhumpers! Keep going. May the snare which they do not know come to them; and may the net, which they have hidden for me, catch them in my place. [ATTACK!] I await your arrival with great anticipation. Run! *moan* Hey, Doc! [BANGING ON DOORS] [Lever sound] The time is now ... 3 AM My advice to you is... aim for the head! Well, that is most troubling. I'm Dr. Mossman. Dr. Judith Mossman. I've been hearing about you since long before the Black Mesa incident. Damn! Let me just send a warning to Lighthouse Point, then I'll come right up to lend a hand! [Combine Button sound] Watch out! Turret! These readings are scaring me. 100 Quick! Good luck out there! Where was I? Oh, yes... The line starts at the end. Ha! Found her! Come on, Gordon! *pain!* Get going! That's one down, one to go, buddy! How about a grenade, Gordon? Hey, it worked. Let's see what I can do to clear the way for you. Keep an eye out for Mossman. I'll get my dad through the prison as far as I can, then I'll catch up with you. [Barnacle Scream] Balm for your affliction, child. Help me win back their trust, Dr. Freeman. Surrender while you still can. Allow me to address the anxieties underlying your concerns, rather than try to answer every possible question you might have left unvoiced. Park it there! Get in here. *pain!* This way, gang. Combat shotgun ammunition acquired. Take cover! Oh shit! Too late! Cover me, Gordon! I've gotta reset the portal. Out. Incoming! Out of my way! The time is now ... 2 AM This is the wrong side of town for you! [Headcrab Death] [Ammocase open] Let's head that way. You're pissin' me off, Gordon. Through here. *howl* This'll do nicely. My Dad's up there somewhere, in that holding area. The Eli Vance is indispensable to the liberation. Go on out. Over here! Good news is, the vortigaunt's working his magic on your airboat, so you'll have more firepower going forward. Hello, Dr. Freeman. Incoming! Hurry! Now! Prepare to receive energy. Dad! Down here! Unless we wish to say unflattering things about you. That's enough outta you. Hey, over here! Hey, let us out of here! The gravity gun! Freeman. [Ammo pickup] Ahh! Check for miscount Meanwhile, let's get this show on the road. I'm not calling about that, You promised you weren't going to touch Eli. Follow me. The Freeman honors us by his presence. Oh no! Get back! I said 'move!' Oh shit! Figures. Well, if it isn't Gordon Freeman, at last. Pardon me. No matter how many times I've been relocated, I never get used to it. [Village Siren!] [Dog Damaged] *pain* [Elevator Called] Help me, brother! Almost there. Take cover! You fool! I'm sorry, Gordon, I can't stop them from here. Hurry! We've got something. Oh, hello, Alyx! Well, almost all right. Lamarr has gotten out of her crate again. If I didn't know better, I'd suspect Barney of trapping and ... Here, take a look at this. I don't know how you things have survived as long as you have. It's going to be tough dodging Civil Protection out there in the open, but drive hard and you'll make it. I'll radio ahead and let the next base know you're coming. Hey! [Headcrab Alert] We will charge you. We're tearing up the railroad, covering our tracks. *Combine Soldier Death* Ow! I'm warming up the portal to deliver you even now. Take Gordon out of here! Head for the coast! Down there! [Begin Healing] [Sniper Reload] Gordon! Neuro toxin treated crossbow ammunition acquired. [CRASH!] [Locked] [Button sound] Extreme heat damage detected. Now we can cut through the square, bypass the Nexus and push straight on toward the Citadel. That was close! Look out! There goes the external shield. [Slice] I'm waiting, Gordon. [Strider Pain] [Zombie Alert] You're talking to yourself again. I thought you got rid of that pest! [Combine Button sound] Rest now, brother. For you will surely live again. I'm Alyx Vance. My father worked with you, back in Black Mesa. I'm sure you don't remember me though. Now, let's see. The last time I saw you, I sent you up for help after the resonance cascade. I never thought it would take you this long to get back to me! [Dog Surprised] Yes, Alyx, where are you? [Combine Button sound] Winston's been hit. Okay, the core's exposed. [Tau Cannon Fire] [Button sound] [Tau Cannon Charged Blast] What is it, Dog? *moan* [Weapon pickup] Let me get this gate. My Civil Protection status still gives me limited clearance. It's not worth the risk, Alyx. I can't lose you! Get out while you can. Oh shit! What am I supposed to do about it? Hello, Dr. Freeman. The car's all ready for you. There's no time to waste here, Gordon. Get a move on! We never dreamed to meet you in corporeal form. I'm not sure how to take that. Get the hell out of here! I can't remember the last time I had, well, anything. Although they call me crazy I care not, for thou art my helper, my strength, and my saviour. Not that! We thought you were here to help. I wasn't careful enough. Breen knows everything we learned. You have to stop him. Local torniquette applied. Bleeding has stopped. [Reloading] Come on. Would we model ourselves on the trilobite? What's the point? According to the schematics, there should be a vent behind those shelves. *pain!* I'll send them on their way, and then we can talk openly. Now let me call Dog. He loves to play fetch. [Boop] You coming? [Warning Voice: Confiscation Field Failure] Antitoxin administered. range 1 meter [Combine Button sound] [Gunship Alert] Alyx, I thought you were on watch. Lead on. The time is now 1 am Take me. Nice shot! Finally, change is in the air! The time is now ... 2 PM Gordon Freeman! It's incredible you made it! We've been getting communications from Alyx. I'll see if I can reach her again. Regroup! Having both of you in my keeping ensures I can dictate the terms of any bargain I care to make with the Combine. Yeah, you and me both, Doc. He was about to board the Express to Nova Prospekt. Here ya go! Sorry, Gordon. It must be fought tooth and nail, beginning with the basest of human urges: The urge to reproduce. What a way to go. Fascinating. We have to get to the horse! ...They're always departing but they never arrive... and the ones that do arrive... they never leave... you never see them go they're always full... no one ever gets on but they're always... they're always departing but they never arrive... Hey, you're gonna bring trouble down on all of us! That's my father's work you stole. I almost hit you. I'm gonna be sick. [Empty chamber] [Low Health Warning!] [Combine Radio: Requesting Backup] Wound sterilized. [Locked] I have been proud to call City 17 my home. And so, whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts unknown, Dr. Breen... Dad! The time is now ... 11 AM 10 [Locked] Are you still with us, Dr. Freeman? Not for much longer, I think. And reap we shall. We are mindful of the words of our greatest philosopher: companum gannennen vorgenot! Here goes the rest of the neighborhood! We have lost all dear to us. We'd better hurry, Gordon. You're never gonna get traction in that gravel. Try the slope down by the water. Dad? How long are we just gonna wait? [Metal Screeching] Grenade! Pardon me. range 13 meters How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass? Later, please. You've stirred up Hell! A man after my own heart! Good timing. Okay, Alyx, we're all set. I think he's just finishing up now. The Freeman can also coax his antlions to attack specific targets. Observe the training manikin, and mark it well with another pheropod. *moan* Just like old times, eh, Gordon? He's not moving. *laughter* I have a few things to attend to, Dr. Freeman. Let Eli show you around. Come to the light I carry! Come! Freeman, we're on your side! Antlions! Ready when you are. 1 We've covered a lot of ground in the last few months, but things would go so much faster if we had more people with your training. We're in the scrapyard airlock stuck in a full autocycle. Ooh! Accept energy. So, I see you've met Dr. Mossman. She's one of the main reasons I spend so much time outside. The antlions won't bother you now, Doc. Uh oh. I'll stay here. You hurry on. Good luck up there, Gordon! [Locked] HEV critical failure--failure--- It looks like it's waiting for us. We know all about you and Breen. You've been a spy for the Combine the whole time. Using the laser guide, you can steer your rocket past the gunship's defenses and prevent it from shooting down your rocket. Wound sterilised. Morphine administered. Guards! Get in here! New in town, aren't ya? [Distant Siren] Over here, brother! Now, brother! Step into the cart! *pain* Get in! Oh man. Overwatch owns the roof, and that's where we're headed. Go on! Let me see if I can scout a new path. Let them out! [Turret Retire] [Turret Activated] Take that chopper down, and you should be able to tear on through to Eli's place. I know you tried to help. I'll stay with him awhile. There's something I have to do. Take it easy in there. You're safe now. Hold it there. The time is now ... 5 PM Got one! Dog! Come! *Zombie Death* HEV - general failure. *death* Hacks! Cover me! Okay, two more generators to go. [Drawbridge moves] It's good to see you, Gordon. Be careful. The time is now ... 6 AM Gotta reload! Gordon Freeman! Come on. [Outrushing Water] [Scanner Death] I'd get into the basement if I were you. We're bracing for an attack. The Combine rewarded him with power. [Camera Destroyed] Oh, Dr. Freeman... You can park the boat. It'll be safe here. All right, I'm moving. Jeez. Civil Protection catches you down here, it's bad news for the whole railroad. Vital signs are dropping. Evacuate area. Warning. Biohazard detected. Okay. [Tau Cannon Charging] Warning. HEV power level below...5 percent. Okay, it's resetting. [Buzz] Don't let it catch you standing still! Time remaining ... 20 seconds. We can't be seen talking to each other. Well, is he here? For a brief time you joined with us. You are one. Between the worlds. This steerable rocket launcher is our best bet for taking down a gunship. *laughter* Get in the elevator. I'm on my way. Hard to believe we made it this far with all our parts. Yes! We have survived worse across the ages. Are all the accomplishments of humanity fated to be nothing more than a layer of broken plastic shards thinly strewn across a fossil bed, sandwiched between the Burgess shale and an eon's worth of mud? [Lever sound] Stay close to me, brother! Excuse our gauche vicissitudes Excuse me. So sorry, Judith. I'm all out of time. Oh! Here's Eli now. How came you here, brother? choosing instead to embark on a path of ignorance and decay. Make no mistake, Dr. Freeman. This is not a scientific revolution you have sparked...this is death and finality. Let me seal this door. Instinct is inextricably bound to unreasoning impulses, and today we clearly see its true nature. Instinct has just become aware of its irrelevance, and like a cornered beast, it will not go down without a bloody fight. Minor lacterations detected. Get going, Dr. Freeman. We know Eli Vance is depending on you. 9 Hang on, I'll see if I can figure out how to get that gate open. Vital signs are dropping. [Heavy gun firing] I'm with ya buddy. I told you they'd be coming for us next! Shorepoint to New Little Odessa. Sorry, Doc, but look who's here. What's wrong? Alyx, sweetheart. This is regrettable. No! All right, Gordon, go on through. Go ahead and get in the boat, Dr. Freeman. Oh no... For the Freeman! See you when I see you, Gordon. [Lever sound] Warning: Vital signs dropping. Over here! Bleeding has stopped. [Crossbow reload] Watch out for the hoppers. They're everywhere! Voice system activated. Ready? Let's go! We're coming with you, Doc. Doc, we don't have time for this. Some things I just never get used to. The time is now ... 6 PM Don't struggle. It's no use. Until you're where he wants you, there's nothing you can do. [Boom!] Get ready for another wave. Follow me. Oh crap. Here come the dropships! Stop where you are! Stay on the rocks! Chur lung gong chella gurr... Then what have we missed? Is it the Freeman? I'll put it on your tombstone. Gordon, get a move on. Good. Now keep it close. Man of few words, aren't you? Gordon, hit the core with your gravity gun. I had a feeling even he couldn't help us. Even if you offered your surrender now, I cannot guarantee that our benefactors would accept it. Look out, Freeman Minor lacerations detected. Come to the light! Hey, Doc? Are you there? Dr. Kleiner said you'd be coming this way. I don't think it occurred to him that you might not have a map. Go on, Gordon, give the core a jolt. [Dropship Pursuit] [Water Splash] Done. Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it. Let's see. The massless field-flux should self-limit and I've clamped the manifold parameters to CY base and LG orbifold, Hilbert inclusive. Conditions could hardly be more ideal! Dad, please... Now get out of here. Here come the hacks! I don't like the looks of this. We fear we have failed you. You're all right vorty. [Locker Sound] Fantastic! [Flame ignite] *pain!* What I've seen is also beyond words, Breen. Genocide... indescribable evil... [Pistol Shot] Here goes nothing. It is not me you want, but the light that shines through me! See if you can stack some stuff to climb up here. Run for your life! Anyone else pickup a 647-E reading? This way, Gordon. [Rumble...] Far distant eyes look out through yours. Just a minute. The Eli Vance almost perceives the All-in-One. The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. You're coming up to another control room. Looks like it's still occupied. Oh, and by the way? Nice to finally meet you. We will remain if you so instruct. Bleeding has stopped. [Tau Cannon Charged Blast] Looks like we might be able to get through down there. [Mine Activated] [Wood breaking] Hey, it's me. Open the door. Ugh! There she is. Antidote administered. I see you made it through okay. Figured you would. *moan* Hello, Dr. Freeman. Hold the signal, Judith! Keep moving. Head for the roof! Oh Light of Lights! Why have you taken my helper? Ok, here's the deal. Excellent. Initializing in three...two...one! Cut it out! I will send the cart for you, brother. It will be but a moment. Sorry, Doc. The filter-field will screen you out. Combine soldiers can get through there, but you can't. Assume nothing This brings me to the one note of disappointment I must echo from our Benefactors. Obviously I am not on the ground to closely command or second-guess the dedicated forces of the Overwatch, but this does not mean I can shirk responsibility for recent lapses and even outright failures on their part. I have been severely questioned about these shortcomings, and now must put the question to you: There's a first time for everything. Are you blaming me? [Wood straining] Therefore I say, yes, I am a collaborator. We must all collaborate, willingly, eagerly, if we expect to reap the benefits of unification. You have your mother's eyes, my dear. And only the universal union that small minds call 'The Combine' can carry us there. My arm! In there! May they become like dust before the wind; may the angel of the Lord pursue them. Come on, Gordon, we've got to get out of here. Maybe we still have ... You should nip that kind of talk in the bud. We're going to reconfigure this teleport and get the hell out of here. Good, here we go. Everything's going to be okay. Let's see if we can find Mossman. It looks like this station might give me better access. You got it, Doc. Now, now, there's nothing to be nervous about. We've made major strides since then. Major strides. That's why we put up with you. Deactivated activated Gordon, keep the turrets set up. That's it! They're all down. Nice! No, he's getting away! I'll have this door open in a second. Antlion! My guess is there's a bunch more soldiers heading your way. You got here at a bad time. We'd better get moving. Instinct slyly and covertly compels us away from change and progress. [Sniper Alert] We cannot forget those whose cords you cut. Forgiveness is not ours to bestow. Who are you? Dear me, you're right. Gordon, would you mind plugging us in? A week... We'd better hurry. We've got to tear down this camp and get out of here. Oh my God...these poor people... I've gotta stay here. There could always be more runaways coming along. To me, brother! Dr. Freeman? I figured you and Eli would want to talk about old times. We can talk later. Good doggie. Our place is here. I think I can recalibrate the Combine portal to get us out of here. Ah! What's going on? Yeah! Major fracture detected. Well I can't take all the credit, Doctor Freeman proved an able assistant. It's a standard panel. Follow me. [Dog Surprised] Look, he's dead! Let's do it! I can't shut it down. Looks like he's turned over control to the other side. You'll have to go into the core and do what you can. We claim you. *laughter* You go ahead, Dr. Freeman. Spend some time with Eli. I'll be back as soon as I catch up on some work. Its energy empowers us. Uh, roger that, we'll run standard loyalty check procedure 243, my 10-22 intake station, over. This tau cannon once killed many of our kind. Use it wisely. Something is drawing him away. You don't know what you'll unleash! You could bring down this whole Citadel! Think, man, think - of the people below! Well...I will leave the upbraiding for another time, to the extent it proves necessary. Now is the moment to redeem yourselves. If the transhuman forces are to prove themselves an indispensable augmentation to the Combine Overwatch, they will have to earn the privilege. I'm sure I don't have to remind you that the alternative, if you can call it that, is total extinction - in union with all the other unworthy branches of the species. Get your car in here! I remember your true face! Huh Well, Barney, what do you intend? That's it. Sorry, Freeman. In there! [Button sound] [Breaking Ceramics] A great deal, my dear. Sweet! Hold. And what terrible wonders are these those hast done among the dead. What shades rise to confess thee, and what specters shall know thee by thy name? [Rollermine Shock] It spotted us! We've almost got that portal working again, but I wouldn't blame you if you didn't volunteer for the next trial run. Gordon, hit the core with your gravity gun. We beg your awareness Hey! Help me out here! Where to now? And to what end? Over here, Dr. Freeman. *laughter* When this is all over, I'm gonna mate. We've got to get my father out. The Freeman will now break out his pheropods and toss one into yonder pit. Farewell, Brother! I fear I deliver you to a darker place. May the Light of Lights illuminate your path. [Knock knock knock!] I'll stay here. *pain!* I warned you this was futile. Automatic medical systems engaged. Gordon, go through the airvent behind the shelves. Don't worry, they'll find one. This simple fact has far-reaching implications. It requires radical rethinking and revision of our genetic imperatives. Shorepoint to N.L.O. I shall have someone open the gate for you immediately, so that you can drive on. I understand that Dr. Vance is in great need. They have given us the strength we never could have summoned to overcome this compulsion. We're ready when you are. We'd better hurry. The Combine can be slow to wake, but once they're up, you don't want to get in their way. [Single Shotgun Blast!] You were amazing back there, Dr. Freeman! But I feel sorry for anyone who put down a security deposit. There! Is there reason for delay? Uh oh. Company. We'll find you another pet headcrab! There are plenty to go around! Go on, you two. Look out! There he is! Here we go... Aaah! They'll get you started on the right foot. There. ...carbon stars with ancient satellites colonized by sentient fungi. Go on, Gordon! Careful there, Freeman. This way, Dr. Freeman. We'll take the cliff path before another gunship finds us. Power restored. I didn't see you get on. The Freeman must now hurry on! The Eli Vance is held in distress most dire! [Barnacle Pull] Hold it. [Citadel siren!] Oh no! Drive the car in here. All right. You can go. The Freeman will accept this weapon, or suffer greatly on the road ahead! Okay, this is bad. [Bullet--Near Miss!] Time to suit up, Gordon. You vorts aren't half bad. Fire to dislocate that interpose! I wish Eli were here. Maybe he'd have some advice for us. Don't let it see you! The Freeman will do wise to heed our extraction of the myrmidont's aromatic pheropods. The process is not entirely hygienic. Therefore, stand aside. Flee, brother! I'm working up the nerve to go on. However, we cannot count on such developments. Doctor Freeman's reputation is such that other desperate renegades are likely to grant him a great deal of license in the spirit of spreading general chaos and terror. There's that gate I was telling you about. We'll have to come back here after we get it open. If we get it open. If he's managed to repair it we'll end up there. Still getting that 647-E from local surveillance. In our current unparalleled enterprise, refusal to collaborate is simply a refusal to grow--an insistence on suicide, if you will. *pain* Hey, go! This is bad. Give 'em hell, Doc. [Flaregun fired] Be free, my child! [Scanner Alert] Doctor Freeman, I'll open the gate and let you through. Rollermines! Kill the gunship, then we'll go. I cannot fight them all alone! No, Dog! Hey, it's Freeman! Let's follow him! This way, Gordon. The Mark V Hazardous Environment Suit has been redesigned for comfort and utility--- Stay with the car, make use of the thumpers, and you'll stand a fair chance against the antlions. There's a turret in the stairs right below you. Try knocking it over with a grenade, if you have any left. Ah, Black Mesa! I do so envy you, working with Eli and Dr. Kleiner when they were at the top of their field. [Headcrab Emerging] [Suppressor Launch] It's not all hopeless. Give over your essence. Come on! Dr. Breen, as I have stated before, you have to let Eli come around on his own you can't just ... Gladly. Whoops. [Elevator Bell] Stop! Run for your life! [Wood Breaking] I'll take you out on the cliffside path as soon as you kill that gunship. There's no way we can make it with that thing harassing us. 7 My dear, I had given up hope of ever seeing you again. We're all set on this end. Go on! Teach that gunship a lesson it will never forget! Wait a second that's not Gordon Freeman! Right then. Are we gonna get going soon? Empower us! Just this once I hope you're wrong. Laser guided rocket launcher acquired. Oh, Alyx, sweetheart. Very well. And, eh, Gordon? Good to see you! I don't know about you, but I'm ready to join Civil Protection just to get a decent meal. Yes, Barney, what is it? I'm in the middle of a critical test. Well, come on. Dr. Kleiner's waiting. [Hiss!] [Death] Hurry! [Thump! Thump! Thump!] Uh-oh. Turrets. You've got the HEV suit, you deal with them. Then I'll work the security console. [Camera Retire] Don't move. [Klaxon!] [Crow Pain] This way, Gordon. How did you do that?! My gut! We're planning to set up a staging area for attacking the citadel. [Door Sound] Enough of your mumbo jumbo. intersect... Impossible to describe with our limited vocabulary! Well, as long as he stays away from checkpoints we should be okay. Time remaining ... 15 seconds. It's your turn, Gordon I'm with you. [Door Sound] Damn it all! [Sprint On] For the days of my life have vanished like smoke, and my bones are parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as fuel for that fire until nothing remains but the Light alone. Then maybe you should let me do the calculations next time, as well as installing it. Keep it up, Gordon, it's working. [Turret Retire] Oh my God, the portal's opening. What do you mean he's not there? I gather you've disposed of that gunship, Dr. Freeman. Your reputation, sir, is well deserved. [Engine stop] Over here! Let me catch my breath. Vital signs are dropping. Evacuate area. [Forcefield Hum] Propitious alliance. [Grenade Timer] I guess I'm getting used to you vorts. Remember the turrets, Gordon. Not exactly. [Tau Cannon Jolt] [Eye-scan Approved] Eli...if you won't do the right thing for the good of all people, maybe you'll do it for one of them. I smell an ambush. Thanks, Leon. Gordon, I haven't driven the coast road in over a year, but I have no reason to think it's gotten any safer. Meet me in the depot where the trains unload. Take care of yourself and I'll see you in Nova Prospekt. Never. [Turret Deploy] [Drowning] Hope is in sight. [Crash!] *pain!* *moan* What the hell? *pain!* Dog, come! I do not want to know what kind of meat this is. Okay, got it. I'm afraid I'm flying blind here. Every now and then a vortigaunt gets captured and sends back information, but we don't have a complete picture of the place. The little we do know is all bad. Power restored ... 15 percent. Warning Voice: Miscount Detected In Sector I found him wandering around outside. Bit of a troublemaker, isn't he? I'm really not at liberty to say. Good plan. Try not to let it get to you. Let us through! Look, Gordon. Look at what you are throwing away. Is it worth it? If only you had harnessed your boundless energy for a useful purpose! We stowed our rockets in the lighthouse. Help yourself. That's why I called you, Leon. I was hoping you still had the scout car we left with you last summer. The one my Dad rigged with the tau cannon. Wait for me. 2 The time is now ... 7 AM Galanga... Great Scott! [Explosion!] Look at it, Gordon. Come! They're flooding areas up ahead with manhacks. Careful, Gordon! What's going on in there? ---from your area. What did I do to deserve this? Bon voyage, and best of luck in your future endeavors. [Combine Button sound] range 14 meters What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness. By our honor. The time is now ... 12 AM [Health Vial Pickup] Hey, it's an armory. So... again I am alone. Zombies! Eli's hideout is here, a stone's throw from the apron and nestled in the old hydro plant. I ask you, what greater endeavor exists than that of collaboration? [Ichthyosaur Growl] [Door Sound] I guess you proved you can handle yourself out there. He'll help you if you let him! We are honored. This is more than anyone can bear, but we will persevere. [Zombie Snarls] Don't---! You are deluded Did the lungfish refuse to breathe air? It did not. Traitor! It crept forth boldly while its brethren remained in the blackest ocean abyss, with lidless eyes forever staring at the dark, ignorant and doomed despite their eternal vigilance. Get out of here. Halt. I am Father Grigori! You have already met my congregation. Well, there used to be a bridge here. Damn magnet's failing...hold on! Hey, patch me up. [Inrushing Water] Get away from there. We'll help however we can, Doc. Clear. *laughter* Down there! Indeed it did... and the repercussions were felt far and wide, but... That was over a week ago! Are all the accomplishments of humanity fated to be nothing more than a layer of broken plastic shards thinly strewn across a fossil bed, sandwiched between the Burgess shale and an eon's worth of mud? It is just as well You're scaring off the pigeons. He doesn't have a clue, does he? Dad, are you all right? I'll keep my eye on you. More than that, I cannot promise. and started at the shadows that leapt upon the cavern's walls. Let's get out of here. Main station is right around the corner. Drive safely! You're Freeman, aren't you? Doesn't bear thinking about. Warning to the Freeman. I just knew it was gonna be one of those days. Behind you! Lamarr is extremely wary of your crowbar. And if you see Dr. Breen, tell him I said, 'Fu----ou!' range 12 meters You have my gratitude, Doctor. First you lead me straight to the doorstep of my oldest friend, and then you deliver yourself. If I'd known you were going come straight up to my office, I wouldn't have bothered hunting you in the first place. I can't get this tune out of my head. [whistles] Gordon! I wish I shared your optimism, Doctor... I wouldn't say that too loud. This is his base of operations. The man I saw, I'm all but certain it was... Get going! Hoppers! Believe me, that tunnel is sealed for a reason. Dr. Freeman, I'm coming with you. [Door Creak] Ow! Lead us. [EXPLOSION!] Once you're safely ensconced in the transmitter, we can begin. Hey, Doc. [EMP Burst] Insufficient power. HEV shutting down. Doctor Freeman, wait. We'll come with you. We are yours. HEV damage sustained. Watch out for the beams! range 4 meters Freeman, take us with you. Automatic target acquisition system deactivated. Look out! There goes the external shield. Head back to Freeman. While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us. Vital sign monitoring activated. Dad! Look out! [Starting Antlion Repeller] [Wall Grinding] You'd better get going before they sweep through here. You're doing the right thing. Can I get a little medical attention here? The Freeman shows his excellence in all things. [Crowbar Whack!] Hold still or we cannot charge you. No! A predictable failure, Dr. Freeman. Looks like it's about halfway there. He's the Administrator of this whole vile business now. Go! Allow me. Uh oh, here they come! [Dog Growl] [RPG Launch] Feel free to look around Now for the tricky part. I'm glad you made it here in one piece. No! It's gonna take some doing to get him out. Blood loss detected. Antlion! Here, ammo! It's an antlion guard! Fine scientist, Judith. She was up for your job at Black Mesa but you edged her out with your Innsbruck experience. You'd better reload! Gordon, you made it through Ravenholm? Thank God! I need your help! They've taken my father! They have no reason to come to our place. [Crossbow shot] Thy rages have come down upon me, and thy fears have agitated me. Don't worry. No! [Train Horn!] Stay away from the core. What's going on, Judith? The time is now ... 10 AM That was brutal. [Headcrab attack] Give it a try. Well, I wouldn't believe it if I couldn't see it with my own eyes. Dr. Gordon Freeman himself. Antlions! Guard yourself well! 5 Gordon, I can't move. These snipers got me pinned down. Wow. With that much security, there must be something good in there. Go for it, Doc. I'll wait here till you shut it down. Be careful. *laughter* His figure is synonymous with the darkest urges of instinct, ignorance and decay. Some of the worst excesses of the Black Mesa Incident have been laid directly at his feet. [Primary fire] Okay, come across! Here, my pet. Hop up.
There you go. I don't think that one's getting up again. You came through again, Doc. [Merle Dandridge] There's a lot of energy that goes into shaping Alyx and making sure she stays on the right path or stays true to the vision that I think we have for her. I want Alyx to be liked, I know everyone at Valve wants Alyx to be liked, but what is really great is that if I get off course or if I've been in the booth to long and I'm starting to sound a little naggy, then I have somebody who's there to pull me back and say, 'Hey why don't you try it this way,' or 'I think you're veering off course and starting to sound like somebody's mother.' Because I'm there to help, if you're lost-you know, the 'Get goings,' or stuff like that. To help keep the game moving and keep you on track. There's kind of a fine line. You don't want somebody constantly bothering you but you also want a friendly companion, somebody to help you out once in a while. So trying to not go one way or the other was a bit of a trick for us. [silence] Do not overlook the larval pellet. Hey, Freeman, try throwing those mines back at the chopper! Dr. Kleiner gave us the Borealis coordinates. Now Alyx do you have all the information you need? How about I stay here and try to keep down the zombie population while you see if you can shut that thing down. So, uh...is that your boyfriend? Had enough? Any chance of outrunning it? [Matt T. Wood] This scenario required significant changes to the antlion guard behavior. Players of past games were used to dealing with only one guard in a confined space and without anywhere to hide. In this scenario the player had a safe zone, but couldn't remain there to accomplish their goals. One change we made to the guards was in altering how they throw objects at the player. Originally, they shoved objects directly toward the player at high speeds. These objects were really hard to dodge, and if you weren't paying complete attention, you could easily be blindsided and killed. The guards now hurl objects along an arcing trajectory, which not only gives the player a greater opportunity to dodge, but looks awesome. The player gets to see the guard launch a car from a hundred feet away, then step aside just as it crashes to the ground where they were standing. [Jeff Lind] For attentive players, this is the first time we've allowed a glimpse of the G-Man since Half-Life 2. In Episode 1, we suppressed G-Man visitations completely to show that he had lost track of Gordon. But after Alyx's healing incident, earlier in Episode 2, he is actively watching again. Keep an eye out for him. The rocket's destroyed! Now they're flyin' em in. Great. Promise me Dad! [pain] What - what's that? What? Look out! Two lights. We can do this, right guys? Yeah, sure, we can do this. I think we misunderestimated. Yes, well, I think perhaps Gordon had something to do with their success. Whoa! You've really got a way with those Magnussons! If this sensor is anything like the others, it is attuned to the presence of antlions. This is it! Take that turret down, Gordon. Dad! Kleiner has it all cued up. No time now! I'm ready! Sheckley! Let Freeman handle the mines! Yeah, we did it! [strained breathing] Well, this is all very amusing, but we must not forget the gravity of our errand to heal the Alyx Vance. This is a fitting end. It has to. We have averted an immeasurable loss. What's this one? ''Flight termination system...check links with backup range safety sites...''? Now we have a strider coming in from the water tower. 36 again! Wow, for a minute there I thought you were gonna get a hug. Somebody must have done something to piss it off! I'm glad they're on our side. The button, Gordon? Please let him go! Hey, come on. [Vortigaunt shock attack] You handle 36, Doc! Mm. No power though. You know what I'd give for a shower? I'd give you up to the Combine! Just kidding. Hey, I was living there! The whole place is lightin' up, grab a tunnel! That's right. Now toss it at the main body of the strider. They're rushing us. Thanks for the help, Freeman. Behind the Freeman. [Turbo on!] Nice work out there, Doc. We scored! Not right now! Or you do... The vorts are calling you. Now, where were we? Damn bugs. [Impact sounds] You felt it too, didn't you? [Power Off] Well... [Blast pulse] Let's hit the road! Yes. If the Freeman is in agreement, let us find our way to that vibratory haven. [sigh] He's coming through! I'm afraid we'll need to leave for the Borealis right after the launch. Shotgun! Continue that line of action, Freeman. Press on, Freeman! If you are able! There can't be many more. [moans] [Jon Huisingh] We wanted players to use the car as much as possible, both to move around the valley quickly and to run over hunters as a quick and satisfying way of killing them. To encourage this, and to help with orientation problems, we added a radar to the car which indicated the location of enemies. This made the car a more valuable tool in the battle and solved the navigation problem once and for all. This road will take you near White Forest, but be wary that others may use it as well. We're not going to get the car any further without disabling that force field. That was too easy. Good. Now take out the firearm of your choice and shoot the device. Lost it. Oh yeah. Down there by the vort. Everything you need for doctorin'. I will trust you to seal the silo doors. Good going! That's it, I'm pissed. Just leave the car there for now! [Lift starts] What a mess. This could take a while. Spectacular The small ones are quite appetizing. Beware! I had thought it was widespread. Punch it! Fear not, Freeman. Busy now, Doc! Good, good. Nah. I think I see train tracks down there. Gordon, keep an eye on him? But the Alyx Vance...her condition is grave. Antlions. [Vortigaunt chanting] Here goes. [Merle Dandridge] I really consider working on Alyx, my acting school. Because it has stretched me, it has made me go deeper in my work, it's sharpened me up as far as being able to call on emotions, or really just imagination. A creative spirit is really just a lot of imagination, I think. And afterwards I always seem to be sharper in everything I do. I always have a good show at night or I always go onto the next job with a heightened awareness or heightened presence. And it's only helped me, so thank you Alyx for that! Nothing in here. Dad! There's always a risk, Eli. I'm sure he'll be along shortly. Look! extract Those crates were almost certainly of no value. Did you hear that? [Mumbling, unconscious moaning] That's it for me. Likewise! And farewell! It has been an honor! Get off! Freeman, you appear sickly. Avail yourself of larval pellets! That did the trick. but I have agreed to abide by certain... The situation is not going to investigate itself! May we never lose sight of the All-in-One, the One-in-All. Well, we can't proceed without Gordon. Yes, Alyx, is everything okay? better than we thought Come on, come on, give me five. [sigh] Follow, Freeman. God damn it! Ah, a puzzling predicament of the sort which the Freeman is famed for swiftly solving. More at 24! This is not the end. We killed it! We killed it! A ready source of healing is at hand, Freeman! The grubs are here for our benefit! Take that! 24's lit up! More lights, we can do this. [Mumbling, unconscious moaning] The route is circuitous, but arrival in the nectarium is guaranteed. Long time no see. In fact, we've never met. Don't look at me, I don't know what those vorts want The creatures exude many valuable compounds, but the extract is the most prized by far. These antlion dens run deep. [vort attack sounds] Gordon... We need to get the transmitter powered up. Not sure what I just did ...but it worked. the betrayal and nova prospekt Busy now, Doc! Get back! [vort calls] [sobbing] I knew it was too good to last. We got 36! There was no stopping her, Eli. What is it, Izzy? What have you got? In here! It must be this van. Um, where's Dr. Kleiner? Let's get in there! Nice shot! Oh god... Magnusson's gonna be pissed! Woo hoo Wonder how long it's been deserted. I detect a dawning light of logic in the Freeman's eyes! Is she ok? [struggle sounds.] Yes. What the-? Looks like you found the place. Come, Freeman. To the surface! [David Sawyer] We've gotten better at building combat spaces that are open and tactically versatile, while still directing the player toward an optimal play experience. This combat is on its face pretty straightforward, but we're doing some subtle things to keep the experience even and well paced. We're using quite a few of our combat tools in this one scene. As the first soldiers enter the barn, we send them in the right direction with an initial cue about the player's location using an npc_enemyfinder. The first soldiers serve primarily to draw the player outwards, where the real meat of the combat takes place. The wave of soldiers that spawns as the player rounds the corner to the exit, are the most directly controlled. One pair uses Assault Points to dash across the open ground and flank the player on the right. Others are constrained to hint groups in and around the house across the way, spaced so that the player is hit with an even front of fire, keeping them pinned for a while and encouraging cautious sniping and probing at the windows and doors. The hint groups are important because they keep the soldiers in strong tactical positions and prevent them from rushing the player to their own disadvantage, as they would if left unconstrained. The broken down truck gives a vital bit of midground cover as players leave the barn and advance on the house. Finally, as the player leaves the barn, we spawn the reinforcing Hunter. We hold this back both to keep the difficulty more even, and because the Hunter combat is better when the player has pushed outwards before it begins. Bullets are useless! I need a nap. Kleiner, where are you? Okay... [vort attack sounds] Okay... Yes, yes we should. [vort chanting] [vort attack sounds] Zombies. Good idea. Nice work out there, Doc. Hit it! [Dario Casali] To create a climactic finish to this level, we ramped up strider density and citizen presence, and then systematically destroyed outer installations in order to move the action as uncomfortably close to the base as possible. It was important to us that everyone be able to play to the end of the episode, but we also wanted them to feel that defeating the striders required a heroic effort. A balance had to be achieved between the feeling of being overwhelmed and the possibility of completing the level. We made many tradeoffs to keep the experience enjoyable while keeping the intensity high, and sometimes this required removing enemies. For example, Elite combine soldiers originally took part in this invasion, running in and around the striders and hunters; but this additional level of enemy fire proved frustrating for players, and so they were removed. All right, Gordon. Got a signal again. The cries of this Guardian no longer threaten our extract. Kill it, Freeman! I'd like a better view of the fireworks. [quiet laughs] Whoa... Soldiers! Completed, of course. [Blast doors fully open] Come on, come on, let's go. [breath] [moans] They're all waiting for us. When their only experience of humanity was a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor. Come now. The vehicle we seek is in the encampment above. We really need to get going. We must try another direction...the extract aroma is weaker here. [Distant Growl] It's at the door. The strange thing is, it was all attached to a transmission from Judith. Take it down! I need to talk to my father. [death sounds] Look out! For god's sake, hurry. Hey, that guy, what his name? Just died. White Forest, do you read? Good God! [pain] [Laughter, shouts] [Dog vocalization] Well, that's one way. More ammo over here! AHHH! God. Damn. It. Reloading! At this time, you may kill it without consequence! [pain] Defend me! Everything seems to be in order. Dad! The sad fate of these others is our good fortune. [vort pain] So, um... We're not free of them yet... Three lights! We got three lights! Not my chosen label you understand, but it seemed to please the personnel. I think I see the car you were talking about. Well doesn't that beat all. I think we're getting close. Get Down! I hadn't noticed this before. What's going on? No, of course not. Now he's using my little girl. Yes, yes! Of course! You think this is bad, you should spend a day working in Magnusson's nursery. More health over here! Dr. Freeman, you take care of the turrets. [vort calls] [Portalstorm blast!] Not this time! [vort calls] This sensor will light up if an antlion is coming down this tunnel. Thanks for the help, Freeman. [sobbing] Go on in. Whoa... There is no such thing as an AR3. [Mike Dunkel] We always look for opportunities to add narrative touches in our levels. The idea behind this chair, the submachine gun, and the beer bottles is that someone used to sit here, drink beer, and drop grenades into the pit of zombies. We give the player the opportunity to re-enact this experience by giving out unlimited grenades and spawning zombies as soon as the player reaches this spot. Hey, it's Gordon Freeman! No wonder! Wait! Oh my god. The Combine's on the move I'll open this hatch to let you down. The guardian! Mind if we keep Dog patrolling out here? Where do you think you're going, Freeman? A mineshaft! Advance, Freeman. I never thought I would see this day. [laugh] Well done, Freeman! That seals it. We're dead! You go ahead. I'll look for supplies. Ah... Let's get out of here! So... We follow the Freeman. You're an inspiration, Doc. [Bridge breaking] Sorry about this. Die! [to self] Freakin' bug. [struggle sounds.] Doublekill! No! Cover 24! It's up to you to seal the launch doors! The extract! I wonder if he got any of that. They're up to something. What are we waiting for? Oh! Finish it, Doc! [Hunter hits] To our glorious end. Oh well...I bet that stuff wasn't worth the trouble. Let's go. Dog! See her safely to White Forest, Doctor Freeman. I'm comin', I'm comin'. Home sweet-aw, shit! We should get the power back on. Whoa! [vort calls] I know this isn't the best time to ask about this Did we do it? Was that it? Somebody please tell me that was all of them! [pain]  OVERWATCH VOICE: ONGOING SECTOR SWEEP. BIOTICS CONFIRMED. CONTINUE SURFACE SECTOR SWEEP. REMOTE COMPLIANCE. EXTERMINATE. SEEK PASSIVE SIGNATURE IMPRINT. MANDATE SUBLEVEL RESTRICTIONS. Don't forget your car, Freeman! As if anyone could! Better now! Thanks for your help! I can't go in there till the turret's out of commission. Anyone? [Laughter, shouts] A vibratory oasis! [gasps] [sobbing] Something's downstairs! This will give you more time. [Scott Dalton] Level Designers and Artists now have the ability to create unique effects as needed for game play or to add dynamic life to a level. In this case, this simple water leak wouldn't have been possible before without involving a programmer to create a new class of effect. Thanks to the new particle system, unique effects like this are easily created as needed without any programming. This leak adds a visual point of interest to the area, and also blocks direct line of site into the nearby corridor without blocking the space itself. These effects can be placed and controlled within levels, attached to animation events of characters, or called by code. Allowing particles to be attached to objects in the world, emitted from a model's hitboxes, and locked to bone positions allows for them to serve a variety of functions, such as the new Vortigaunt beams or the burning effect of a zombie. We hope this feature will allow level and mod authors to create a wide variety of effects quickly and easily to suit their purposes. Nooooooooo! Now, let's move on to a more challenging task. I feel compelled to thank you, personally, for saving my rocket. It's gonna take a damn miracle to get us out of this. That turret's had it. Up there [Hard kick!] Goddamn Hunters... On your knees, Strider! Right, Gordon? Cover the vort! It's going to work, right? Noo [sobbing] [Mike Durand] In this scene, we wanted the player to feel under tremendous pressure to break through the boards. Ideally, they just barely make it through the opening before the guardian arrives. To get this effect consistently, we had to reduce the number of boards again and again until we saw playtesters consistently scrambling to safety at the last moment. We've got to get moving! No matter! Magnusson, did you hear that? A vibratory device! These are most effective at repelling antlions, as the Freeman no doubt remembers. I'm glad to see you too. That was unbelievable. quite warm Ah! Strider! Done looking around? We really gotta get ready. We should proceed secure in the belief of copious larval extract in a nest of this size. Gordon... One time, back in the city, I saw a guy take down a hunter with his bare fists! Another strider coming in towards what used to be the sawmill. Freeman [breath] Let me see if I can get it working again. There it is again. This calls for covert progress rather than confrontation. The Alyx Vance! Oh my God! Hello?? Now, Magnusson--- Dad, no! What the---! You handle the breach, Doc! Throw something at the hunters! I won't if you won't. Nice shooting, Gordon! Over there! [struggling] [pain] Whoo hoo! Here he comes! Here comes Freeman! [pained breathing] Yeah. Yeah! What's that? They stopped firing? [pain] Shit. [Kerry Davis] In this scene, we rigged an entity called a physics explosion to create movement among the boxes inside the dumpster. One playtester threw a grenade into the dumpster and the physics explosion entity caused the grenade to fly back out. The player was shocked, thinking the zombie had tossed back his grenade. Although this happened by accident the first time, we went ahead and set up the entities to make sure it would happen for every player who lobs a grenade into the dumpster. What do you think, Freeman? They comin' back? Those things that attacked us at the mines... hunters, they're out there. Oh my god... The hunters aren't making this easy. Wow, Gordon. You were amazing out there. There we are. Come on, try to keep up. [Chris Chin] Here are some prototype sketches showing the evolving design of the bridge. Research, sketches and construction. Hasn't Black Mesa taught you anything? Eat it! See the cord, Gordon? You want to plug it in? Well, the precision of those readings is not to my liking, but we'll have to make do with what we have. Too many! A strider! Allow us to recharge your cells. Your car is fueled and ready to go. There'll be nothing left of her. [Static] I've never come in from this direction. That is why we must hunt and kill all we can before they emerge and gain their full power. [sobbing] I think we misunderestimated. It's getting away. Here we stay. A poignant scene. An eternity's repose. It brings peaceful thoughts, does it not? Keep up the good work, Doc! If you think you're up to it, we'll let you out there. Kleiner, are you going to sync up the satellite? Or should I postpone the launch to make time for a family reunion? Merely the favor of her continued protection, [vort speak] Beware, the acid-lions spit from a distance! Getting colder. [Splash!] Hey, Freeman-high five! (beat) Wow. What a jerk. yeah, I copied the whole packet. Die! [to self] Freakin' bug. Where's the water tower again? Well, I see the Magnusson Device performed flawlessly. Nice one, Freeman! And if you see Gordon Freeman, tell him to get his butt in here! Looks like there's been trouble here... Now why would the Combine put a roadblock way out here? I'm following you. We need your protection! [Richard Lord] This whiteboard art went through several iterations, from highly stylized, to absurd, to something we believed we could ship. Onward, Freeman! [struggle sounds.] The antlions are keen to our presence. Close your eyes, honey. Now...try carefully to rise. That way you'll get to see the gun before it sees you. There you are. Got to watch all the tunnels, Freeman! You coming, Gordon? The Guardian! [pain] [Mumbling, unconscious moaning] Oh my God, no! Look out, hunters Well, that's it. I only wonder... I'll stick by the radio in case we get them back on the line. How? I can't tell you how glad I was to see you in there. It sounded like she was... Come on! [vort calls] So many crates into the abyss. [Dog slams strider] Striders! We got dropships! no more hiding? [Ken Birdwell] Early versions of this area had serious problems; it was brutally punishing and unfun. We were trying to make an experience about timing and tension, but playtesters perceived this as another boss battle, but without physics and explosives there's no way to kill the guardian. They would empty all their ammunition into him and die horribly over and over before giving up and running away. They hated it. Our first solution to this problem was to add an arena immediately before the maze, where we hoped players would use up most of their ammo on headcrabs and barnacles and not even try to shoot him. But clever players managed to lure the headcrabs into barnacles and rush past while the barnacle was feeding, arriving in the guardian's lair with plenty of ammunition and again with a false impression that they could kill the boss. In the end it was necessary to have the Vortigaunt tell the player 'Remember, do not kill the guardian or the extract will be ruined!'--therefore justifying why you wouldn't be able to do we didn't want you to do and what you couldn't do in the first place. This area is really fun now. The battle is almost exactly like the original layout, the big difference is that we're communicating our expectations to the player, rather than having them learn by dying. Alyx Vance? Eli! Gordon! Alyx! Look at the portal I will make the journey to seek the extract deep within the nest, in the sacred nectarium. Look out. [pain sounds] attention, your attention please. Congratulations to the staff and residents of white forest. [Web rips] Out on that bridge... [Jeremy Bennett] Episode 2's backgrounds or vistas if you like are created in a manner that fuses traditional 2D animation techniques (linear cards moving against each other to imply parallax) and a modern Digital take which involves placing these cards in a 3D environment and manipulating their size (distance from camera) depending on the scale needed. A series of cards can sit in front of a 3D Skybox and with the addition of fog\atmosphere a realistic result can be achieved. Freeman! Have you heard a word I've been saying? Truly, the Magnusson's mind is akin to a force of nature. There's the peak again. We're really close to the base. Oh no, it's back! Can you find a way to open this door? I did it! I saved the base! I'm a hero! Oh, and Dr. Freeman's a hero too! If they can blow up an old wood building like that, just imagine what they'll do to a hard nuclear bunker. Free-man! Free-man! Free-man! well, this is quite the treasure trove Yeah! I can always count on you to find a way through. Gordon, I'm in here! They're waiting for you in the sawmill-that way! The Freeman is an invaluable companion. If you can see any way to help, I'd appreciate it, Gordon. Way to go, boy! All right, now it's personal! Frickin three legged jaywalkers! Looks like the road will take us right past it. Let's get inside Gordon! Hey Attention, personnel. Down here, Gordon. Agreed! Come on! I hope we don't get many more. Now, what it is, is a sort of a sticky-bomb, although cleverer than that makes it sound. Not another Black Mesa. [Jeremy Bennett] The view of the ruined yet still dangerous City 17 is a good example of a classic Half-Life vista. Vistas are sweeping scenes where many elements of design come together. This one reminds the player of what he accomplished in Episode 1, while setting up the threat that will hang over the rest of Episode 2. It establishes the mood with a stunning skybox and shader effects; shows off believable character responses, and also literally sets the episode into motion. When the player looks at the scene, a device called a 'look trigger' sets off the portal storm, which causes the bridge to collapse, using Valve's new 'Cinematic Physics' which we will be showcasing throughout the episode. Ah yes, that is an advisor [Mini-teleport idle sound] Did you hear that? Safety test of FTS... I love you. appraisal. She stirs! Oh hell.. Aim for the Hunters! We'll just have to... Do you need anything? Heh heh! Oh my god-not the sawmill! Is nothing sacred? Do you think those boots are my size? [Splat!] this should do it... Ah, no! They're coming through the breach! How do you like a taste of your own medicine? Yeehaw! But we're ready for them. [Steve Kalning] The antlion web sacks, grubs, and workers show off a new illumination shader we developed especially for this level. We began with concept art for the web sacks, modelled those, then added a material parameter that allows the model's self-illumination to be modified based on the angle at which the player views them. The end result is an object that looks lit from within by a weird volumetric light. [Martin Otten] The original design for this sequence involved shutting down the cannon by flipping a switch. That was neither obvious nor rewarding. We decided to let the player blow it up instead, which gave us another opportunity to use our cinematic physics. Yeah... ...stiff, but... Sometimes I like to get Magnusson mad just for the fun of it. Course, it's not much of a challenge. It's gonna take a damn miracle to get us out of this. Hedy? I'll keep watch out here. Well, okay. If you can help me get it powered up. [pain] It's working! Are you okay? [vort chanting] Damn it. Hunters! Hold still. [struggle sounds.] [Hunter charge impact] Cover 24! Oh no, what's that? Freeman! Do you mean the message didn't get through? Freeman can you hear me? That's the one we call the Great Satan. Look! They're trying to help launch a... We've been waiting for you. Just follow the stream, then head up the other side. White Forest is right there. You can't miss it! Seems like we spend half our lives in elevators. Great driving, Gordon. What do you think, Freeman? They comin' back? Do not neglect the larval pellets! Everything okay? White Forest! We await only the push of a highly trained finger. What was wrong with that hole? It's okay, Dad. Wow - I forgot what a kick this thing has. [Skidding sounds] YES! [vort chanting] Well, at least we beat the Combine here. Hm... Prepare to receive energy. Get clear! Finish the goddamn thing! The extract! Beware the acid-lions. Their corrosive spray permits quick carving of rock passages, but also serves as a strong deterrent to hive robbers like ourselves. Good work Gordon! Ah, yes! Turrets! Turrets! Keep them away! [breath] Ugh - let me down! One sec, I gotta reload. we're almost ready to put our first big piece into play. The supercharged AR2 ammo really messes up those hunters. We did it! Oh man, I've been wanting one of these. Those bugs sure messed with the wrong slugs. Let's see where it's coming from. You might want to grab that extra gun, Doc! Gordon, over here! Her heart has stopped! Oh my God, no! [sounds of struggle] [Laugh] We are moving away from the nectarium. We must try another path. [Laughter, shouts] Runnnn! [pain] Help! We got antlions! Thanks again, you guys! Take that, Dumbass! So...what now? Little busy right now, Doc. Get right on it. Here, check it out. There is no time to waste. [struggling] Let us in! Don't worry, Izzy. They just got here. Destroy it! Get those turrets back on their feet! More health over here! We better hurry up in here. when he whispered them in my ear. [Gate opening] [struggle sounds.] Hey, Freeman, try throwing those mines back at the chopper! Such time spent with the Magnusson can be no less than the qualitative high point of the Freeman's existence. Good. Now what I want you to do--- The tether is cut. Well met, Freeman. [Hunter footsteps] [struggle sounds.] They must have a transmitter in one of these buildings. Thank you, everyone. Signing off. Silence. Freeman! More at 36! Those mini-buggers are gonna make it hard for Freeman to get a clear shot with the Magnusson device. Good going! [laugh] There, again! The wire runs back up the hill to those buildings. I have the situation well in hand! go ahead and send him through. [sobbing] All right, back to work, everyone! We're picking up something on the radar. I see an antenna! We have to get there ahead of them! I know, I know. Yeah! Well, let's give it a try. [struggling] I HATE BUGS [moans] Izzy! Quickly. Go safely! Three hunters...I hope that was the last of them. [Dog vocalization] [Blast pulse] Truly, Freeman - too long have we been apart. I think you stunned it. we're done running. Oh crap! The engine! Ok. Thank you. Here's where we turn it all around, eh, Freeman? Yeah. Yes! Everyone return to base! Repeat! All personnel, return to base immediately! This rocket must launch! Now. [Matt Scott] One of our toughest jobs is tuning for difficulty. There are all kinds of ways that sloppy game design can make players miserable when they are supposed to be enjoying themselves. If the player is laughing as he dies, it's a good sign--it means the death is perceived as part of the entertainment experience, that the player died fairly and not as the result of poor design. But if the playtester beats his head on the keyboard, we usually take this is a sign that there is still work to be done. Ow! [Ominous sounds] [Creepy ambience] If you see a bug on me, how about you try and get it off next time. We are launching. Right that turret! [pain] That sound. The extract! The Alyx Vance depends on our success. [pain] Freeman, you did avoid the grubs on the way in here, right? Throw something at it! I just wish someone would have warned them about headcrabs. Avionics to internal power? Doc, help the vort! We don't dare launch until all striders are destroyed. [Milton Ngan] Some testers had trouble realizing when they were doing damage to the antlion guards, so we've added a bleeding effect that grows more serious as the guard's hitpoints decline. This kind of visual feedback makes intuitive sense to players, it suits the biological nature of the creature, and frees us from having to rely on spoken explanations of gameplay. I can't believe you said that. I'm responsible for putting her close to breen. Ah! Oh no! A turret just went kaput! Come on, man. Sheckley! This'll even theodds. Move not. It seems they've grown to share my estimation of her worth. That's gonna leave a mark. Now with overwatch decapitated they will mobilize local forces until ties are reestablished with the realm of command. Long time no see. In fact, we've never met. The launch is in its final stages. Look well. [Hunter flanking signal] Whoa! We'll be lucky if this thing even makes it to the base Well, you won this time, Dog. Head on in there, Freeman! This data's gonna be useless if we don't beat the Combine to White Forest. I did it! I saved the base! I'm a hero! Oh, and Dr. Freeman's a hero too! [cheering] Yes, yes. Hey! It's the vorts! They made it! They've hit the bunker! Gordon! Upstairs! You handle 24, Doc! Yo! Let em through! When a tunnel lights up, we move a few turrets in front of it. We Shut the portal! I love you, sweetheart. Thank God! Heh. Dad... More lights, we can do this. it's time we took back our world. Stay close, ok? medium for a message of some importance. No time now! No time now, Doc. Oh man, that was cool! I've got a baaaaad feeling about this. Thank you--that was troublesome. Do you see a gate control in there, Gordon? [vort attack sounds] Okay, I'll hold you to that. He reminds me so much of myself at his age. We are of one mind in this matter. [pain sounds] Attention, Freeman! It is critical that you seal the overhead silo doors and stop this infiltration! Is Freeman ok? Yes! The rocket! We're dead! Let's see if there's a transmitter around here. Shut up! Swarm at 24! White Forest - this is Alyx Vance. Do you read? [Dario Casali] We experimented a lot with the ammunition for this level. Originally, we had a single ammo crate containing submachine gun bullets, positioned down near the elevator. Playtesters, however, seemed happier using the shotgun in this battle, so we added a crate full of shotgun shells and moved both crates to the top area, so players could easily trade off between the different styles of gunplay. In here! So...what now? Careful, Freeman! Recklessness is a slippery slope! relay these words: she needs us alyx. You'll need that cool-ass car of yours, Freeman! Abide a moment, Freeman! Till I draw apace! Antlions approach! we require your vortal signature. The portal's getting bigger. Where the hell has he gotten to. Next portal I see, I'm jumping through it. Anywhere's gotta be better than this. Hey...an extra pair of hands. Now to find the radio room... You ever miss Black Mesa?  I do.  And I was never even there. [Dog vocalization] Come on back, Gordon! [Tongue-slither] I downloaded the whole packet. [Stalactite impact] Allow us to treat your wounds. Good doggie... We normally run supplies out to the White Forest base, but a few days ago the Combine cut off access. Listen! [Garage door closed] Next portal I see, I'm jumping through it. Anywhere's gotta be better than this. [Laughter, shouts] [John McCaskey] Some playtesters didn't realize that they would need to climb over trucks to navigate around the autogun emplacement. So we added this truck jump early in the level as a form of introductory training. Oh, man! Brains! [Doug Wood] At the climax of the turret battle, we introduce the new vortigaunt in full-on action mode. The player can and should take part in the battle, but we were careful to make it fairly easy for him to hang back and enjoy watching the vorts clear the room of antlions. We wanted to show off the vortigaunts' new abilities and get the player excited about the role they were going to play as active allies in the struggle against the Combine. Dr. Freeman. I'm not a big fan of your work at Black Mesa, but you've been doing a bang-up job lately. [vort attack sounds] [struggle sounds.] [Thud!] The Combine encroaches. But if it's Good going. There should be quite a show.  Regrettably, I can't come out with you. I need a nap. Freeman, are we done? Gordon! That...doesn't sound good. Whoa! He said the trap door was up there. What if that's why they were sending so much data from the Citadel? Can you blame an old man for wanting grandkids? [Elan Ruskin] The turret battle design went through many changes. Early stages had the player controlling 3 turrets and not ever having to fight antlions directly. After playtesters complained of not having anything to do during the battles, we changed the number of turrets to leave the player underhanded when in later rounds all the tunnels are active. This creates a better mix of resource management and combat. Later we added this tweaked version of the hopper mines to give players yet another tool for fighting the onslaught. [pain] hard to be sure. I guess we'll find out when we get there. Can you find a way up there? Ms. Vance doesn't look so great, Doc. You better hurry up and follow the Vort. Damn bugs! Mmm. Here, let me open the gate. Don't you understand the gravity of the situation? Stop! Get inside! [vortigese] Magnusson must've sent you, eh? Way to go, boy! Should have known it wouldn't be as easy as just driving down the road. Looks like we'll have to take a detour. Hm? We are the one and the many. Human host. Look out, hunters Do you smell it, Freeman? The extract? The nectarium is near. We couldn't get in till you sealed off the silo and the blast doors opened up Is it the Freeman? [vortigese] Wow, nice work, Gordon. Look. Rocks must have shifted when that shockwave hit. That was amazing the way you threw their mines right back at em. Let's take the fight to the Combine, Doc. Straight to their universe. Whaddaya say? We need to reach altitude and transmit the signal. I do not see their sentries. They're in the house! Not right now! Hear that? No fear. We will put you on the right road The Freeman must advance. [Antlion grub alert] Hey doc, you cover 12! Switch on the elevator! Through here, Gordon. Pick your turret up! Sheckley look out! here. Okay, Dog. We're gonna win, Dog! I'll stay with the car. [Chris Grinstead] The ambient sound of the poison zombie breathing was placed here to make the descent into the building scary. Although most of the team thought it was comical, there were a few playtesters visibly unnerved by it. One playtester stood at the opening to this room for a long time, afraid to go in. Wouldn't hurt to do a little recon. [Marc Laidlaw] In this first part of the episode, we are restoring the player's connection to Alyx by recalling the sort of collaborative activities you shared with her in Episode 1, from combat to collaborative puzzle solving. Notice that as she works to restore power to the transmitter, she is careful not to steal the player's fun by doing it all herself. She doesn't actually solve the puzzle, although she sometimes thinks she has. This adds to her charm and helps her feel more human. Of course the reason we're doing this is so that you will care when bad things happen to her. Think you can get us down in one piece? They sure hate these Magnusson devices! Dad - are you there? it would appear you've plundered the citadel storehouse like a pair of latter-day data pirates Good, I just... I'll keep watch out here if you want to look inside for the cache. We're trapped! Did you see that? If I had a gravity gun, I'd be right there with you, Doc! Looks like our message got through after all. Come on, we'd better hurry! I wish you didn't have to head off so soon. All personnel, return to base! As time permits, you must familiarize me with your own novel methods for finding entry. [Engine start] How the hell are we gonna shake this thing? Something tells me we haven't seen the last of them. It's around here someplace. Can't quite get a bead on em. Maybe just uh... We did it! Antlion husbandry was once our ancestral practice. Got one. Uh! Now, you've proved yourself capable, and the staff seem to respect you. Therefore, I'm putting defense of White Forest, and this ingenious new weapon of mine, in your hands. We've got a ton of data. We should check it out. That's one down. Clear away these antlions! We'll get her back. Good enough. We've got to get to White Forest. if she were here today. Practice as long as you like. The gravity gun. Go for it! All we have is yours. Thank you. Damn...it's empty. [Splurt!] You mean after all that, we're still stuck? and even these are held together by baling wire and duct tape at this point.  Head for the next thumper! Propitious alliance. Don't--- [vort calls] I'll be fine... No interruptions! Fantastic. That is all we can spare. We will help you. Hey...a power cord. How'd that get down there? We're doin' pretty good. Such a theory is hardly far-fetched. Magnussons over here, Freeman! We should get back on the road. Duck! I told you it would all work! I knew it would work! So, when you're out in the field, you're going to be punching Hunters? [Bill Fletcher] Our main goal with this scene was to create a cinematic battle of the titans, Dog vs. a strider. While we were excited with the early implementations, it became obvious that players were uncertain of their role in the scene. Originally the confrontation built slowly with Dog squaring off against the strider, but having such a slow beginning proved problematic. It looked great in the trailer, but didn't play well in the game. Instead of the slow build, we decided to send Dog straight into action. He makes a grand entrance, jumps on the strider and the fight is on. The quick start helps to grab the players attention instead of giving them too much time to worry about what they ought to be doing. I don't think that was the last of them. Dad, it's not what it looks like. I'm fine. Never seen this many all at once. Right this way. They're at the breach! You'll hear no objection from me. Let's send our warning and get out of here. It came from upstairs. I think you will be very glad you saved those crates. Defensive positions! Go! Oh god no. [pain] [struggle sounds.] Next to me. We have lift-off. Wait up! You better heal up doc. [Jay Stelly] Wherever possible, we try to mine our robust physics engine as a source of novel puzzles; it is especially valuable for giving realistic feedback to the player solving the puzzle. In this scenario, we designed the elevator to sink slightly whenever the player steps on it, giving instant intuitive feedback that it reacts to weight. This made it far more likely the player would understand that he was dealing with a counterweight puzzle. Big day today, eh Gordon? That immense repellant device promises surcease from endless antlion attacks! Dropships incoming! Okay, Dog. Let's take a walk! Alyx! There they are! Uh... Izzy Three lights! We got three lights! These ones burn flesh! Indeed yes. This is White forest. Identify yourself. And 24! They could have used a crash-course in outland survival. AR2? Nooo... Now, an AR3, sure. plenty of times. [Merle Dandridge] A really cool experience was that, while I was at Valve I was talking to one of the animators in the hallway, and we were just carrying on the conversation, I was getting to know what he did, and I just happened to be looking over my shoulder and noticed that people kept popping their heads out of their offices. And one of the other guys noted to me that these people, bless em, they have to sit around and listen to my voice all day long. So for that voice to be chatting in the hallway was a little weird. I guess I kind of liken that, I can understand it, because the very first time I saw my voice on Alyx Vance's face, it was so bizarre. And so when I watch people talk to me for the first time and they've heard my voice as Alyx, they have the exact same expression and I'm like, I understand. I get it. Can we get a move on? That can't be it... [struggling] Freeman, go help the vort! Well stated. There's no time to waste. The Freeman's cord is cut. That's it then - I'm pushing it. Try and stop me! Get that thing! Yeah! What could possibly be taking him so long. Good luck, both of you. Oh my God... Ah man, they got em. Gordon!  Alyx is right in there, Dr. Freeman. oh fie! Hello - Dr. Magnusson? Freeman... Oh Gross Gordon! Wait for me! Let us hurry, Freeman. [struggle sounds.] How long have I been out? Your peers await. You're heading our way? Well I should hope so! FTS switched over to internal power. Uh oh [sounds of struggle] [pain] Ably done! [vort speak] I can only imagine what it would have done if... We must press forward! I've got it all packed up and ready to go. Those hunters keep shooting the Magnussons! Yeah! Help, Gordon! You're better with it than I am. Dog! We don't need to both defend the car, Gordon. I could get used to living out here. [Cave ambience] [Transmitter off] Alyx - my goodness - is that really you? [struggle sounds.] Where's the water tower again? Not too difficult at this range, is it? Gets a bit harder when it's moving about and firing at you, of course. The Bright One perishes. A matter of hours. Those hunters keep shooting the Magnussons! I take it the old portal satellite array was functional after all. Right in the melon! Goddamn Hunters... Hmm? The Gravity gun? Judith... Our hands are occupied. Ahh crap! Antlions! oh dear. On second thought, maybe you shouldn't send gordon just yet. [Autocannon Destroyed] Gordon... Not this time. [struggling] Many were dispersed from the citadel when its destruction was imminent [vort chanting] Ain't gonna happen. Up here, Gordon! Heh. They haven't skimped on security either. We'll catch up with you in a moment, sweetheart. Shall we pull the plug? Portal storm! I heard vortigaunts a few minutes ago. Maybe they're still around. Damn these mines! You made it! The door! [Charlie Burgin] We like to lull players into a trance, then startle them. Here, we convince players they are expected to explore and solve puzzles for a long time, then we abruptly change the mode of gameplay by throwing grenade-lobbing zombines at them. Well, I could sure use a drink. Who's with me? Looks like they're set to fix you up here. We need to keep moving. Use care, Freeman! Once the rocket is in range of the portal, we'll be able to switch on the xenium resonator.  Yeah, we could do that. Give over your essence. Here take this. minus one or two titular functionaries we are almost certainly better without I've got a baaaaad feeling about this. Watch out!   But I cannot hope to bring it back alone. There! Did we lose it? You're an inspiration, Doc. That one shall trouble us no more. Let's get out here. Ah, such a pleasing sound and sensation. [pain] I wouldn't say we've got them on the run, but...hell, it's a start! This is not the way to the nectarium. [pain sounds]Help... We'll wait for you here, Gordon. [Gasp!] It's the...Borealis! Hey, Freeman, come on over here. Dad! Strider spotted at the cranes. We'll head right over. No. We cannot heal a moving target. I knew if you both stayed together you could get through anything. Her injuries are grave. [vort chanting] [Matt T. Wood] One of our main goals for hunters was to make the player feel he was vulnerable wherever he might hide. This arena in the secondary silo became our testbed for improving the hunters' close-combat behavior. A classic combat space, featuring multiple exits and many possible paths, we tuned it for a strong cat-and-mouse gameplay experience. While players have many options for escape, the map is designed so that hunters will never completely lose them--but always be able to pursue and flush the player out of hiding. Hey Doc, if you need a gun, there's extras around. Hit it again! There you are! I will look after the Alyx Vance. Are you there? [Skidding sounds] [struggle sounds.] [vort chanting] Done. [struggle sounds.] Striderr! Off, get off. You've ably demonstrated what happens when the device is not shot. Now shoot it. [Dog vocalization] [struggle sounds.] They're coming! Uhh. [Strider unfolding sounds] Here, ammo. Good man, Gordon. It is good that you fight with us. It's worse than I feared. What do you think, Gordon? Oh... Perhaps the Magnusson is best suited to operate the Magnusson device. [vort calls] Health over here! Gordon... Now, every building in the valley has its own dispenser port so you'll have ample supply of explosives. Grim piñata.... I don't know. This is supposed to be your area of expertise. This way, Freeman. Nice driving, Freeman! Oooh yeah! Oh god, Zombies. Blip-blip I need to... What are we waiting for? We will finish this. Gotcha! Oh yes, we've been monitoring the situation. The raw discharge of the melt-down has been focused into a coherent beam of portal energy. Along with the transmission from Judith. Look out! [Jason Mitchell] One of the major graphical enhancements we made to the Source engine for Episode 2 was the addition of shadow mapping for the player's flashlight. This allows the flashlight to cast soft dynamic shadows into the world, adding realism and drama to the scene, particularly in dark underground areas like this one, in which the use of the flashlight is required to navigate the space. As you move around, notice that all objects in the world cast and receive realistic shadows from your flashlight. [John Guthrie] The massive strider battle was in production longer than any other map in the episode. Tuning it required many, many months of testing and iteration to address playtest feedback, and this was complicated by the fact that every time we playtested, we saw individuals adopt completely different approaches to defeating the striders. Some threw logs at hunters; others relied on their rebel companions to kill them. Some players never sprinted, while others never used the car. We tried to keep supporting all the different strategies that occured to players, so that their experiments with tactics would be rewarding rather than frustrating. Meanwhile, we had to make sure the strider and hunter behaviors were consistent, and balance the experience so that it would be great for all different play styles at every skill level. HAHAHA YEAH! Thanks. [struggle sounds.] Look at this car! They must've brought in every strider on the continent! That's right. Lucky you! Dr. Kleiner thought of everything. It's a... hey! I used to know that guy. Over here, Gordon! The lift has arrived! He's in the silo 1 access unit. Right through here. When I couldn't find you I got... Yo! Let em through! They're going after Alyx! Oof! But for God's sake, be careful. But do not neglect the small and obvious details. [struggle sounds.] Take this ammo. Word to the wise, don't eat the k-rations. They put something in 'em to make you forget the suppression field's down. Thank God you're all right... you'll be careful. [Dog vocalization] A radio tower.  OVERWATCH VOICE: VITAL ALERT. AUTONOMOUS UNITS SUBSUMED. MANDATORY COMPLIANCE WITH ALL TENENTS OF ADVISORIAL ASSISTANCE ACT. THREAT LEVEL ADJUSTMENT. PROBE. EXPUNGE. 12's going crazy! Behind you! [Vortigaunt blast] Return to the void. Hunters! Yet many more remain. Yeah. Why are there so many? [vort calls] Well done, Freeman! You take care now! [struggle sounds.] Hello, Dr. Magnusson. What's that? That thing has to be destroyed! It is well Yeah, well, that's a theory I'd rather not test. [vort chanting] [laughter] Damn. Do we have any idea how long until the superportal's active? [moans] Finish it, Doc! Now, I must get back to my rocket, Freeman. Oh God. [Gate open] Good boy. Isn't that right, boy? They're inside! Look! Well done. and it's all right here you say? Gordon! Oh...unless you want it. I'll fill you in on the road, Gordon. Never again. They're traveling in packs! But getting a launch off while the Combine was intact - there was just no way. We should get out of here before it comes back. Nope. The Alyx Vance! Heads up for headcrabs. Over there! [Vortigaunt chanting] Dad! They're not gonna catch me off guard again. Yeah! That means two or three, right? Dog! Oh my god... [struggle sounds.] We'll be fine here, Gordon. If only it weren't so critical...  The Alyx Vance clings to the margins. Mind if I tag along? We're close, thank God. There is no time. More antlions approach. Activate the elevator, that we may reconvene! it's as if we've brought back the original black mesa science team for a grand reunion. We are yours. Damn these things. Hours? Awesome. [sobbing] A dropship! Dad? They killed whatshisface. We shall prevail. That hunter targeted the Magnusson! Quickly man - the ladder. Hey, Freeman-high five! (beat) Wow. What a jerk. Not only did they help me fix the car, they threw in a bonus. [Inhalation] [vortigese] The Freeman must be healed. Oh my god! [pain] but I had to wait until your friends were otherwise occupied. I think so. A moment longer. [Merle Dandridge] As I'm sure a lot of people know, I perform on Broadway. And sometimes people will show up at the stage door with Alyx Vance posters to sign or just an encouraging word about the game. 'Oh my gosh, I saw in the playbill that you played Alyx Vance!' It gets me so hyped when people come up to me and are excited about the game. Because I don't get that immediate feedback that I get on stage every night, so when somebody tells me that they liked it face to face, it's really exciting to me. So I guess a couple of people have taken pictures with me at the stage door. And I went through a phase where I wanted to know what people thought of the game, so I was looking on message boards and checking out what the chat was, and I found that thread that had a picture of me with somebody at the stage door. They were talking about, 'Look, this is me with Alyx Vance!' And the first response was, 'She is so ugly!' I thought that was cute. That must have been the crash we heard. We don't have much time... Let's get going. get em off me. That's the base alarm, people! Fall back and defend the silo! Okay, Gordon...let's keep moving. Hm. [moans] Oh, rocket launcher! That'll come in handy! I had no idea. More ammo over here! Splat! We need more defense at the silo! ---But hold! The Alyx Vance is slipping away... We must hurry! I see an opening. Cover 12! I wonder how long it's been since anyone stayed here. And the Breach! Stop the car, Gordon. So in the old days, people actually kept gloves in here? Something shifted up there... This way freeman. No way you're driving out past that. Hey, Doc, time for that later. The Freeman must hurry! Woo hoo [Sounds of wordless awe] Is everything all right? To the lift, Freeman! Do not wait on me! [Door closed] Gordon! Can you see the car yet? [Flechette pre-explosion signal] Awake! Arise! Dammit! These feathered fiends are the most persistent I've ever... I know, I know - I shouldn't have worried. That supercharged ammo for your AR2 will kill hunters with one shot! Yes, forward. When's the last time you heard from her? the combine won't see this coming. You know, it's a good thing I don't get carsick. Fortunately we have the Freeman... Transmission? however, recently we've hit upon a brilliant plan to reverse the portal's polarity AHHHHH! [Steve McClure] Sometimes very small changes can make a big difference. Originally these troops all marched in lockstep, using the same walk animation. This looked extremely robotic. We took a second walk animation that had been done for this troop skeleton -- a more upright, casual walk -- and programmed each soldier to randomly blend between the two walk-cycles as he crossed the bridge. This thirty-minute change made a huge difference in the scene. Don't look at me, I don't know what those vorts want It should have been lost forever. We will continue our hunt for Advisors. If you have the strength, we should proceed. Good luck taking out that autogun! [Merle Dandridge] So, the circumstances around creating Alyx were so kismet that it's almost a little scary. Because I mean if you think of the ideal super-self that you want to be, having bad-ass moves and being able to karate-chop everybody and then add onto that a writer to make you sound witty at every turn, it's like having an uber-self for me. So I immediately fell in love with Alyx. [vort speak] [vort attack sounds] We vortikind possess an ancient affinity with this peculiar secretion, and know how to transmute its properties. As one of her race, her frequency, Launch that thing. Hey there Doc. [pain] We should go back through the compound and see where the road goes. Assent. Don't let em get line of sight! Dr. Magnuisance, I call him. That's why he sent me out here. Gladly. Well, I, oh-- What would the Combine want with a place like this. Bugs. I'll come find you in a little while. I must be tired What was that? I think I can walk on my own now... BAM! The grubs are nothing if not...succulent. We have no idea what to expect. [pain] No! Her thread unravels, but is not yet rent. [Dog grabs strider] [struggle sounds.] I hate these things. [to self]I'm gonna make it. I am gonna make it. Let's get back on the road. [struggle sounds.] All right, people, this is it! Yeah. Easy there! Oh - oh, excuse me if I'm interrupting tea time. They are coming from everywhere--strider spotted at the water tower. Yes, take the Freeman! but I wouldn't exactly trust em with my life. What was that? Open the lock, Isaac. Eyes of blue and three feet, too. [Julie Caldwell] Initially, we built this area around the Sandtraps mechanic from Half-Life 2, warning the player that stepping on sand would trigger swarms of antlions. Soon after the warning, however, the safe islands of rock ran out and the player was forced to run across the sand as quickly as possible. Players were confused by this, and upset because Alyx and the vortigaunt would simply say they had no choice, and head straight across the sand. To solve this, we decided to stage the combat with safe zones around thumpers instead. Gordon we can take these. Okay - a communication center. We need help! Let's go back downstairs. Nice work. And 12! Take cover [Dario Casali] Episode Two's rocket defense battle was the largest and most nonlinear combat experience we had built. It was also the first combat we'd created that required the use of a vehicle to move from battle to battle. Our design goal was to give players a broad directive -- 'protect the rocket from incoming striders' -- and let them decide how to accomplish that. Playtesting revealed a number of challenges that we had to overcome, as the freeform nature of the map led to huge variations in success for different players. Small differences in skill or tactics radically changed the difficulty of the experience for players. In response, we had to continually tune all aspects of the experience to support the wide variety of tactics and skill levels demonstrated in playtests. That worked. That was a guardian! magnusson designed a xenium resonator that once in orbital range will activate the old array and effectively turn it into a shield. [sobbing] Hey, wait a minute. That's it! We require...the larval extract. [Oomph!] 'Dr. Magnusson slept here...'' and then we can view it in the auxiliary control room. Yeah! [vort chanting] We'll take 24! Ah! Such quantities of the larvae... such a heady aroma. I thought we'd never get here. Look out, Dog! [Crashing rocks] Well...here we are again. We must remain to keep the Alyx Vance alive! Right through here. All personnel, get back to the base! The silo is under attack! [Dog vocalization] Watch out! There's a sniper up there! Are you all right? Hm. We'll keep the outposts stocked with health They're at 12! [Jess Cliffe] In each episode we start by agreeing on how to use color choices to create and reinforce the right thematic tone. The tint of a scene can be a powerful source of mood. Episode 1 was pervaded by deep reds. For Episode 2, we made heavy use of blue tints in the outdoor areas. The blue was meant to set an ominous tone, while the warm splashes of sunlight were intended to offer visual contrast, that suggest a glimmer of hope. Gordon - you notice anything wrong? So that... Let's catch up with them. [Shock explosion] Caution, Freeman! Nice. Oh my god, HUNTERS! Hello. It's a zombie. Prepare for unforeseen consequences. [vort healing] Oh boy, they're at it again. Let's find the transmitter before any more show up. [Ratchety creaking] Good luck, you guys! [sobbing] We have dreamed of this moment. Thank you, Freeman. Everyone ready? This body is yours to command. [gasps] Return to the all in one. C'mon, Griggsy, move it. The vort's trying to patch her up. [vort pain] that's Gordon Freeman Hey, stay focused! Get to cover and start shootin! All right, the road's clear! Hell of a job you did out there, son. Greetings [vort calls] Oh man. Here we go again. Go on, Gordon. Hey, that's working! [Siren!] All right, just let us secure our instruments and we will be over to see you off. Move toward the top of the launch tube and take all necessary steps to seal the area. although we hate to curtail the spontaneous festivities or otherwise interfere with the celebratory air Yes it was. Oh my god-not the sawmill! Is nothing sacred? Shit [Doug Lombardi] Most of our dramatic scenes are constrained in such a way that the player can't progress until the scene is over. For example, there might be a gate that only Alyx or a vortigaunt can open. In this scene, where the Vortigaunt and Alyx first see the Combine marching on White Forest, we simply placed a few barrels to block the way while Alyx and the Vortigaunt speak. Even with this slight impediment, every playtester stayed and watched the scene as we intended, so no explicit gate was needed. No...don't leave me. [Gasp] Oh, with pleasure. It is unfortunate the Freeman's suit permits external harm. Kill the Guardian now! In the Vortessence there is no end. We need to find some cover. Lead the way. Let's get back on the road. [Derrick Birum] Alyx's robot Dog is cobbled together from spare parts, all of which are in various states of disrepair. For Episode 2, we chose to use shading techniques to improve the look of Dog and better convey his scrapyard origins. Along with upgrades to Dog's texture maps, his shader now uses a combination of Phong shading and environment mapping to increase the apparent detail and diversity of materials, from rusty bolts to the damaged metal flaps salvaged from a Combine scanner. Let's get moving before they send more. Your skills are formidable. Did you just hear something about...Vance? Thanks for your help, Freeman! Come closer! [sigh] [Laughter, shouts] The Freeman must distract the antlions. yes, I'll give it a thorough going over when time permits but first... Regrettably true. Got one! They've been chasing us ever since. This lift will carry us to where the vehicle awaits. [vort speak] [Dog rips strider] Crabs. Thank God...I hope that was the last one for a while. You messed with its eggs? [vortigese] The whole world went to hell that day. [Chris Chin] A great deal of work went into making sure players will see the buildings get destroyed as they travel around the valley in the final battle. While we cannot (and do not wish to) force the player to see these events, we tried to increase the odds that the player would end up in the best possible position for the show. Measures ranged from simply hiding a strider behind rocks, to setting up complex logic conditions that must be met in order for the destruction to occur. [moans] Let us hurry, Freeman. [Dog hits strider] Thanks for waiting. Well, I can see that, I never said- [Chet Faliszek] Griggs & Sheckley started off as minor characters who were just used to explain the setup for the turret battle. Once done, they died fairly quickly, leaving players alone to fend off the antlion swarms. We found this left players unsure of their defensive strategies and would force them to visually survey the cavern before setting up defenses. So we made the two characters stronger and had them yell out their state to players and even suggest what openings the player should cover. This gave players extra time to setup a defensive strategy before the antlions arrived. This also let us also rachet up the intensity level by slowly heightening their reactions to the threats. Once we realized this worked, we decided to separate the characters and create an Abbott and Costello style team to do little bits during the down time the players were using to setup their defenses. We ended up with entertaining character moments that also cued the player on game state and events. The Freeman must stand near. Dad! [struggle sounds.] I don't freakin' believe it. Yes. Here you go. To the void with you. restrictions. Jesus, I've never seen the Vorts this pissed. Remember to keep in constant contact. I'm just so glad to have you back. however, we should see the first effects almost immediately. Oh god, strider! however, I've made very little headway with the data itself Destroy it! No, the Combine's moving toward your location. [Creaking metal] Oh no! A turret just went kaput! Hey, if you have any blinding insights into how to fix this, go for it. You're still my hero. Oh...Antlions...now I know I'm not in heaven. Gordon! Doc, can that grav gun help us? I thought... [moans] Warning to the Freeman. [sobbing] Don't give up now, Gordon. The power has been restored, but still the lift moves not. [pain] It's a trap! We trust the Freeman's ingenuity will bring us back into proximity! you've gotten this far without us. So keep an eye out! [vort chanting] Sounds like it called its friends. [Richard Lord] Having solved the problem of getting Alyx into the passenger seat, we were faced with the challenge of making her a useful companion. When we first hooked up her vehicle combat, Alyx constantly targeted and fired her gun at everything. This made her feel a bit like a turret. In response, we tuned her behavior so that while the vehicle is moving, Alyx fires more slowly, taking more time to aim at high speeds. Here we go... We got a turret down! Well said. The Magnusson has once again come to the heart of the matter. [pain] Ah, the Freeman. We have to defend the vort. Nothing here. Let's get going, Gordon. Stay safe. Caution! [pain] They're talking about us! Gordon! [pain sounds] I was just saying hello to Alyx and Gordon. Ah, excellent-a bounty of larval extract. The way he and Magnusson have been going at it, you'd think they were still competing for grant money. Anyone mind if I take this? The vortigaunt said he was on the way. Let's look in the barn, Gordon. Here come the hacks! BAM! It bears all the hallmarks of Aperture Science. Whoa! [pain] Ready to start autosequence. Let's hit the road! Our purpose is mutual. Head on up there and they'll fill you in on the battle plan. Now there's one at the sawmill. Yes! Holy shit! I will observe with great anticipation! what's this? Hmmm. We have exhausted their immediate number. Well that could be a problem. Dad! Looks like you'll have to find another way into the reactor. Hunters! Three... You're breaking up - come in. [wordless exasperation] [Flechette impact] They lurk, just ahead! I think they want you to push the button, Gordon. the emergency doors will have sealed up tight. Ammo, Freeman. That's not quite the word I'd use. Since the secondary silo staff seem incapable of solving their little crow problem, you will be happy to hear we have put the popular Dr. Freeman on the job. We all look forward to his remedy. Oh my God, no! That's the one we like to call the Great Satan I'll be staying here to watch the field and send status updates. we might be able to shut them out for good. It's one of them. Good grief! Eli! Why didn't you tell me they'd arrived? The Magnusson speaks true The Freeman is most helpful. Turret down! Avoid close contact, Freeman! Freeman! You dispatched those guards with great dispatch! Aim for the Mag Device! This way. Yeah! Freeman, ammo. Dog! Rocks must have shifted when that shockwave hit. There's hope after all. It's got to be about the Borealis. You'll need that cool-ass car of yours, Freeman! I descend! Dad! Attend! And get your cranio-conjugal parasite away from my nose cone! The Freeman honors us. [Wind gusts] The Freeman does us honor. [Strider vocalization] It should start... Yeah. [vort attack sounds] Uh... [vort pain] Here they come again! Steady, steady. Freeman! Are you still in the secondary silo? [Cave ambience] [Strider falls] Wow, Gordon. You were amazing out there. I don't know how you do it. The ladder's here. [Strider vocalization] Our bonds are of nature and require no gratitude. Alt-fire, Freeman! Alt-fire! Rockets over here! [vort attack sounds] Major swarm! More at the breach! [Strider vocalization] Yep, that's where the wire starts. [pain] This shaft connects to the chamber above, where my kin sustain the Alyx Vance. Gordon, how you doing? If I were to... hm. [Brian Jacobsen] Until we added the wooden landing here, players were very reluctant to jump down into the elevator shaft. Some playtesters went all the way back to the previous level, looking for another way down. In the days of Half-Life 1, we depended on players jumping willynilly down every elevator shaft they encountered, but over the years they have learned to be afraid of the things we tend to put down there. If you move we cannot help you. Take that! [Hunter: Enemy Found] We will. We don't have time to fool around. [Fan sound] Ah, Freeman. While you were out having fun, I found an old helicopter that I was able to get working. Swarm! That was too easy. [Tom Leonard] The Inn is designed as a crafted experience that is controlled but not linear. The encounter is intended to create a heightened sense of danger without actually being particularly dangerous. The idea is to create opportunities for some memorable unscripted combat moments by keeping the player a bit on their heels. Normally, Alyx is out of frame during combat and soldiers don't survive very long. By encouraging the player to move back from the windows, the map creates space for Alyx and the soldiers to exhibit interesting behaviors that reinforce the mood of the seige. Take out the Hunters! Oh, Alyx. Nice work, Gordon. Sorry I couldn't be more help. I'm still a little weak. Good hunting. More than adequate. it would certainly put a dampen on the natural outpourings of goodwill if any of our stalwarts were rendered crispy in the super-heated flames of the victory launch Look at him go! [Transmitter on] [David Speyrer] The original Episode Two vehicle was dubbed 'The Jalopy,' which says something about how uncool it was. Early feedback was that it seemed too similar to the HL2 buggy. We decided to redesign it so that players would feel excited rather than disappointed when they saw the car. Alyx's original line when she first saw the Jalopy echoed the feelings of many early viewers: 'What a wreck! Forget about White Forest...we'll be lucky if we make it to the end of the block.' Our mutual friend. [Matt Scott] Due to the number of characters involved in this scene, and the cramped spaces, we found that the actors were constantly pushing the player around in order to get to their marks. We developed some tech that allowed the actors to gauge the position of the player and the other actors, and choose among a selection of marks. This not only solved the congestion problem, but made scenes feel more dynamic. Frickin three legged jaywalkers! I hope we still have time to shut it down. One thing at a time, Izzy Dog... [Gate falling] [Cave ambience] Here have a medkit. I could get used to living out here. Lock and load Doc. Ahh! The last turret just broke! Summon the elevator! [struggling]  OVERWATCH VOICE: ALERT. ANTICITIZEN ONE ENGAGED. VANCE SUBPRIME ENGAGED. EXPUNGE. MANDATE REMOVAL OF ACTIVE SIGNATURE IMPRINT. CAUTERIZE AND EXPUNGE. [Vortigaunt aftershocks] Hey, come on. [Tim Larkin] Creating the sound of the vort's call was a refreshing break from scoring huge explosions or the bridge destruction. We wanted something subtle that would communicate the vort's general nature as well as its specific cry for help. It can be hard to tweak the sounds so hard while still giving an organic quality to the voice. To design a sound that contained a sense of the alien personality, without just sounding like another animal call, we found a way to add and process overtones while subtly altering the phrasing of the pitch. The resulting sounds give the impression that the Vorts are in fact communicating among each other with a dynamic dialog of calls as opposed to speech. [Advisor Blast] [Unknown creature sounds] Oh, man! Brains! There you go. The gun would appear to be powerless. Oh, he's always up for it. It appears they attempted an escape, but made it no farther than the abyss Quite a display. We need to get back on the road, but our engine's shot to hell. Let me figure this out. Sheck, look out! [John Guthrie] Fans of Half-Life 1 may remember a gag involving a microwave oven in the Black Mesa lunchroom. If you push the microwave's button several times, the casserole inside it explodes--a memorable experience for many first-time players of Half-Life. In Episode 2, we thought it was finally time to let you know whose lunch you had ruined, and give you a chance at redemption. Here it comes. They're everywhere! We had a bit of a set-back. Ah... The supercharged AR2 ammo really messes up those hunters. [Shield activated] Don't worry, Dad. We'll be all right. Safe again...for a time. Bring it down! Maybe we should just head out. Freeman you must attend to the antlions. Careful out there! Man Down. Well, this place is hell, but at least it's not North America. Magnusson pulled it off all right. The VORT needs help! [vort speak] [Kathy Gehrig] This vista is one of the largest open outdoor areas we've tackled in our games. When rendering such an area in real time, it's necessary to use various level-of-detail techniques made available to us by the Source engine. For example, the distant foliage and Combine enemies are rendered with far fewer polygons than they would be if they were meant to be viewed up close. Additionally, the organic shapes used to model the rocky outcroppings and valley floor below use complex shading operations to combine a relatively modest amount of texture data. This tradeoff, which requires a manageable amount of texture data, allows us to use more polygons, enabling us to represent more organic shapes which are in contrast to the orthogonal forms common to our traditional urban environments. [pain] The vorts are calling you. [pain] Shh.. Dad. That means two or three, right? Hey doc, you cover the breach! We got 24! We're heading the right way. Finish them, Freeman! [vort chanting] Thank goodness you're okay. Oh my god! [Vortigaunt speech] [Hunter alert sound] Good luck, you guys! Well met, Freeman. Well, never mind him. Do not hesitate Hey, I'm feeling a lot better. We make a pretty good team. [Welding sounds] Never a dull moment, huh? I hope they didn't pick up any of that. Wow. And what about the Combine? Yeah, we're getting it! I can't put this all on you two... They could still be around. I got your back, Gordon! We've got a long way to go to find my Dad. It would be nice to have some extra help. [vortigese] we'll be lucky if we make it to the end of the block. Want to give it a look? [struggle sounds.] Come on, I think we've seen the last of the Combine! We should have beat their asses years ago! There is no finer companion! That's better. It's a guardian! There are many routes to the junction below-I trust you can find your way to join us there. Come on, Gordon. We're surrounded! [vort pain] The blast doors will have sealed due to the alert, so you'll have to go through the bottom of the launch tube. Dad!  Yes! Farewell! Someone's got to bring down that chopper... But we've got plenty to celebrate. All the fresh zombies coming out of City 17 have kept 'em pinned down, but it's just a matter of time till the troops start pushing this way. Lie still. [Fan sound] Dad. Lets get to the car. [vort attack sounds] [Joshua Weier] The striderbuster, or Magnusson Device, started life as a Half-Life 2 weapon called the hopwire. This was a weapon that would leap into the air and create physical connections, via ropes, to the surface around it. Once attached, the ball would be suspended in the air, ready for action. We never shipped that weapon because it wasn't generally useable enough in our environments (especially outdoors). One side experiment created the 'black hole' hopwire that the mod community found in Episode 1's code. You can still find videos of this in action on YouTube. The 'black hole' version created a true physical vortex that sucked anything near it into an incredibly dense singularity. This created a small dense block comprised of all the mass and matter the vortex had collected, which the player could then pick up and hurl at enemies. We returned to the hopwire for Episode 2, where we thought we could use it to tie the strider's legs together and make it trip, but the mechanic of hurling and attaching the strider buster was more fun for players, so we moved the weapon in that direction. Surely the Freeman can find a way to activate this lift. Noooo! [Crash!] The Magnusson device requires no refrigeration. [moans] Here we come. I guess it's self service. [Steve Kalning] Alyx's model underwent some upgrades for Episode 2. We added two new holes to her jacket - courtesy of a hunter - and dirtied her texture up a bit to show wear and tear. We also increased her polygon count - and to help with her jacket we added shoulder blades to her back so that it flexes better when she lifts her arms. Additionally, we reconnected her belt so that instead of being rigidly attached it now flexes and slides around more. A lot of this stuff you won't even notice, it'll just look right - 'yeah, that's Alyx, she's wearing a jacket' - you won't even think about it. It's easy to have the computer draw something stiff and awkward, but doing that pulls you out of the game, you stop believing in the characters. They just become icons. Our goal is to make our characters simply look natural, but to do that requires lots and lots of work and tons of new technology. The irony is, if we've done our job, you won't even notice, it'll just look right. [It'd be good to show wireframes of the model, and maybe 'Before and after' images.] Secretions of the finest quality. Aim for the upper body, man. White Forest... I think that's all of them. Got to watch all the tunnels, Freeman! Freeman, you have anything to take down a chopper? They're looking for us back at the radio tower. [Derisive laughter] Thanks, Freeman. Reloading! Soldiers! [Jeff Sorenson] Even though this compound appears open and non-linear, we're striving for a fairly reliable progression of events, so that we can fine tune pacing. The building on the right is bright and eye-catching, with the intention of drawing the player there first. The entrance to the ruined building is around the back, so that initial exploration through the center of the compound tends to lead to the radio room first. The drop-down entrance from the roof of the ruined building also helps us pace the experience, because players are cautious about committing to a space, until they've explored the alternatives. I hate those freakin things! Nice throw! [vort calls] Ah, Gordon! fallen into They're at the breach! Right through here. So that's what it was! [Impact sounds] Oh fie, the code. This is like a power up. Let's keep moving. [out of breath] That was not perhaps the wisest of the Freeman's decisions. [breathing] [Chris Green] Texturing of these caves provided a couple of significant challenges. We had never made such a large scale area completely out of displacements before. The convoluted topology of the surfaces made them especially hard to UV map without unpleasant-looking seams and texture warping. After some early attempts, we decided that we were not going to be able to map this area using conventional UV-mapping, so we decided to write custom shaders especially for the caves. Our custom shader combines multiple axis-aligned projections based upon the surface normal. This largely fixed our problems with stretching and seams. Since we wanted to provide dramatic lighting in these areas, particularly when lit by the flashlight, we augmented the Source engine's radiosity bumpmapping with a new piece of technology. This allows us to create a form of bumpmaps in which the bumpmapped surface details actually cast soft shadows across the surface. This emphasizes the surface bumpiness, especially when the light is at grazing angles. There's gotta be a transmitter in here somewhere. Let's find it. Come on, Gordon. We got in here as soon as we could. What the hell is happening? According to the radar, it looks like there's a supply cache here. We can do this! We've counted a dozen striders just north of us. Mmm... let me see. I sense the Freeman, down below! But think of the advantage for humanity! We can't simply waste all that potential. Great Scott! Over here, Sheckley. We should keep moving! Oh god... Ho, yeah! Explosive pest! Really, I'm fine. No, I said the - the carapace! [struggle sounds.] Oh God! Would that they were innate and required no replenishment. Now, my dear, where is this data packet you've been carrying? We'll be driving to White Forest in style. [Scott Lynch] In Half-Life 2, the Antlion Guard was originally meant to be a sort of super-bug bloodhound that pursued the player through caverns and harassed him while he slipped into small spaces to hide. While we never realized that design in Half-Life 2, this scenario is, for the most part, exactly what his original design sought to accomplish. Over the course of many years of production on various titles, we've found that ideas often go away into the ether for years or more, only to resurface and thrive in a new game environment. Even failed prototypes can flourish down the road. The opener's way has shut. [panting]Is that it? [Vortigaunts healing chant] Naturally, some time ago. I need some help! Oof! Your reputation was not undeserved. Here you go doc. Magnusson would be proud! Another strider from the water tower. That's all that matters. Dog! So don't get into any trouble. Something's in the house! [Dog jumps] [pain sounds] Defend us! Freeman! Uh, yes. Let me see if I can disable the shields, and get you closer to the reactor. Can't wait to see you. Come on, let's see if we can use their transmitter. [Sliding metal] [struggle sounds.] at least until they've reestablished contact with the combine overworld. Everyone ready? Yes, and they carry Shu'ulathoi. Advisors, still in incubation pods. What the hell does that mean, anyway? Uh oh... [Thud!] In here. We killed many antlions. Get back to your car! Throw something at the hunters! And 12! Its power supply is depleted. Let's get you off your feet. I found a first aid cache! [vort speak] Freeman! You have cleared our path, but yours is less clear. I'll be right back. For now we must not be disturbed. Hurry and get down that ladder. Just kidding! All right, We should get this data to him right away. That's it, I quit. [Erik Johnson] This transmission scene was added fairly late in development, after hearing from playtesters that they weren't sure where they were going, or why. Setting up the White Forest base as your goal right away was important in an episode with so many open, freeform areas where players might forget what they're supposed to be doing. [Bill Van Buren] In Half-Life 2, Lou Gossett's voice lent itself to a mystical and mysterious characterization of the vortigaunt. In Tony Todd's reading for Episode 2, we heard new possibilities for a vortigant who is more of a mystic martial artist. With new attack animations and companion behavior, we worked with Tony to build the vortigaunt into a powerful ally, a full-on alien ass-kicker. Eat the Vortessence, you ant bastards! Hey, Gordon... You're not gonna leave a girl hanging, are you? One more at the cranes! Let's take the fight to the Combine, Doc. Straight to their universe. Whaddaya say? We're right here at the south end of the valley. We'll talk later, Gordon. [vort speak] [Jess Cliffe] This area was designed to train the player in the art of Hunter combat, and during the development process it changed continually to suit the Hunter's behavior. The first Hunter prototypes could be killed only by the blunt impact of physics objects. Therefore, to make sure the player learned this technique, we trapped him in this area with one Hunter and kept him locked in until he had defeated it. Upon the Hunter's death, reinforcements broke down the gate and doors, opening up the arena. As time went on, and the Hunter was modified to make it vulnerable to all types of damage, our grip on the player gradually relaxed, permitting freedom of movement and a wider range of tactics right from the start of the encounter. Dad! Yeah! It looks like there still is. Let's get in. Alt-fire, Freeman! Alt-fire! [Laughter, shouts] Dad? Wait a moment... We've been waiting for you. Just follow the stream, then head up the other side. White Forest is right there. You can't miss it! As long as they're doing aerial sweeps, we should make our way into the mines. Amazing isn't it? Look out! The bridge! [Thud!] Excellent shot! [Siren!] [struggle sounds.] Yeah! What now. [vort chanting] [Jason Ruyman] In early versions of this map, the player was allowed to drop straight to the bottom of the shaft. Nobody ever saw the guardian break through the boards. Therefore we added a small floor area and required the player to turn around to break more boards, making it much likelier that players would see the guardian's attack. More at 12! My fault. [struggling] I love you. Once again, his judgment proves impeccable. Well... It is a pleasure to heal the Freeman. Whoa... The chopper's ready and waiting. Not at all. Go, Gordon, go! Hmm. Let me see... And armed? You gotta take those hunters out first! Don't waste them. Each one is a marvel of craftsmanship. [Leslie Hall] The vortigaunt's dispel attack is a radial explosion that takes out a swarm of antlions. It looks most impressive when seen from above--but that's not a perspective the player gets very often in the tunnels. We designed the exit from this battle purely to give the player a view from above so the vort could put on a show. [NOTE: good spot to take over the player's camera to swoop down and spawn antlions and trigger the vort's attack] Go get em, boy! All right, Griggs! Sounded like a crash! You know, orange is your color; looks good on you. Heads up people, we aren't done yet. Another strider was just spotted at the sawmill. Undeserving of consciousness. As long as you're down here, Freeman, maybe you can give us a hand.  Yes! Eh, sorry, Gordon. This thing's fried. Check-check-check. Don't worry, Eli. Step on it, Gordon! Yes, yes, I'm not deaf. I wish I could do more than keep an eye on you, Yes...there is a quickening... Ah! Use your car, Freeman! That appears to have had some effect. It's vital. [Kathy Gehrig] Having decided that we were going to rely on a car to get to White Forest, we had to figure out how to get Alyx into the vehicle. Games often accomplish this by moving their characters close to the vehicle and then teleporting them inside in a very visible and jarring manner. We knew this would ruin Alyx's believability as a character, so she had to smoothly get into a vehicle the way you would expect a person to in real life. This was no small task given all the strange angles and positions the player could work the vehicle into. Alyx also needed multiple entries into a vehicle, given that the doorway she wanted to use could be blocked or otherwise inaccessible. This also provided interesting moments for Alyx where she could vault over the hood of the vehicle in a very heroic fashion. The interaction between her and the vehicle was intriguing just by itself. Once we were sure she could enter and exit the vehicle convincingly, we then had the task of making her believable as she sat next to you. Our first experiments revolved around Alyx reacting to the physical nature of the vehicle. When it crashed into a wall, she needed to be jolted. When you went around a bend, she needed to lean with the momentum of the car. These details were crucial in making her feel like she was really going along for the bumpy ride with you. We also wanted her to be very aware of her surroundings and what the player was doing while in the vehicle. If you ran over a zombie, she needed to echo the internal reward the player felt for accomplishing the feat. If you were about to hit the wall, we wanted her to flinch and react to the impending collision much as the player at home would be doing. There was a fine balance between making her too much of a backseat driver or having her be too quiet next to you. Ultimately, we wanted Alyx's presence in the vehicle to seem so natural that players would never consider it anything other than normal. It came from the front room. [Chopper engine failure] Reloading! I'm sorry about that doc. I don't think Eli knows you're here yet. We're not leaving without you. My goodness... Two... [quiet laughs] Gordon, come here! [Drowned antlion scream] Quiet you. [vort attack sounds] Regrettable. Wow! It's quiet...too quiet. [Tom Leonard] One issue with a number of our encounters with the Combine is that they don't live long enough for players to experience some of their more interesting AI. Some unique elements introduced here with respect to the Combine are: Branching assaults, so that soldiers introduced to the field don't take up predictable positions Flexible assault points, so that soldiers can stray from designer specified locations to establish line of fire or cover Assault progression is a feedback system so that the timing of the soldiers advances responds to player actions and skill rather than timing We give soldiers different tactical roles. For instance, squads in the field distract the player, allowing other soldiers to execute surprise moves not present in our typical frontal assault scenarios. The net effect of these changes is that the soldiers are perceived to have awareness of the layout of the building that you're trapped in, and a strategy for flushing you out. Looks like we can get into the mines through here. If we could just get this gate open. Make way! We're back! You came through again, Doc. Little busy right now, Doc. Jaywalkers will be prosecuted. Ahem... Well, that's enough chitchat. Follow me, Gordon! Greetings to the Freeman. Wow! [Door open] [Bill Van Buren] The decision to kill Eli was not made lightly, and once we'd made it, we had to figure out how to make it meaningful. We had already established Eli's frailty, as well as his importance to the Resistance and Alyx's devotion to him, so from a narrative point of view the impact of his death seemed obvious. The hard part would be the execution.The advisors' ability to immobilize the player gave us a way to stage the scene, the animations and the sound design made it believable, but none of this would have been enough without inspired performances by Merle Dandridge and Robert Guillaume. Oh no! It's awfully quiet. Go, Dog! how is the project going? Oh man, this is gonna be bad! We call it the Magnusson Device. [Sigh] Got a turret down. Let's just stay here. [Advisor blast] In here. One... Look out: They left a turret. Did you ever--- Never seen this many all at once. Doc.. Doc... doc! I fear at first, to white forest. Soldiers! Oh man, this is gonna be bad! [struggle sounds.] No thanks I'm good. Gordon! In here! Gordon, I guess you should help Dr. Magnusson. Gordon... Thanks for clearing out the yard, Freeman! Heck of a job! I guess it's time to rebuild the sawmill. Freeman, clear out those mines! When you see your dashboard light up, you're gonna want to stop and investigate. [moans] Follow me, Freeman. We're waiting for you Looks like we weren't the first to find this place. Sweet job out there. [Acid antlion scream] I should have know when he rescued her it was for his own damn reasons. Oh shit, the whole place is lit up. Grab a tunnel! Hang on, Gordon! Hey! We may have to ditch the car! The lift, Freeman! [pain sounds]Help... If we are to survive, this Guardian must now die. I'll hurry it along, Magnusson.  Come in [pain] What a wreck I think they learned their lesson. The question is... Gordon, catch! No, no - haven't seen him. Shoot. The. Magnusson. Device. I'm sorry I can't come with you, Gordon. Another strider coming towards the sawmill. They're at 12 again! Yeah, that's Gordon... [Ido Magal] Strong attention to visual design in this room make this unconventional puzzle both intuitive and rewarding. To begin with the room is sparse, with the reward clearly visible, but locked up in the cage. A strange centerpiece draws the player's attention, and the visible switch is obviously part of the solution. The health charger next to the switch hints that the solution involves getting onto the catwalk rather than activating the switch from the ground. The van entrance discourages players from bringing in objects they might use to solve the puzzle by stacking. The lone grenade crate is a strong suggestion that grenades figure in the solution. Finally, the corpse in the rafters and the scorch marks on the ground, and the story they tell provide the most important clue. Good...the power's on. [Dog falls] Ha ha! Whoa! Hey! The hunters aren't making this easy. Press on, Freeman! I will take her to my kin by another path. Stand back. She is stabilizing. [pain] Bring it down! Out of the way! Hey, a lambda symbol! Mmm. [vort healing] The kettle was hot Six... The Alyx Vance depends on us. I'm a genius! It's like...back in the Citadel. We'll take 24! Marvelous. Let us see this obstruction's true nature. That is all. [out of breath] Use it? [sobbing] But came to no good end themselves. Sure thing. [Blast doors fully shut] I'll stay here. [pain] [Railcar impact] [Bridge girders break] What heals can also harm. They're like striders... but smaller. The chimney! Watch out! Good God, man. Carapace. It means 'shell.' Aim for it! Good shot! woodland creatures excepted [pain] I believe I've found the perfect use for you. The Freeman is no longer. Dr. Magnusson, is that you? Keep alert. Oh my God - the Citadel! Gotta reload. Well, it's all but certain she found borealis Sounds like it called its friends. I knew if you both stayed together you could get through anything Hold on a sec - I'll let you out of there. Be cautious at each turn! [Antlion guardian pain roar] Die! Special, this week only. You got that right, sweetheart. I suppose there's something to be said for physical reinforcement of the intellectual bond. Hey Doc, if you need a gun, there's extras around. What's it doing? [Jason Mitchell] For the ominous mass of clouds which swirl above the destroyed citadel, we devised a shader effect to give the impression of depth and complex turbulence. The actual geometry rendered for this effect is a single flat polygon but, through a series of pixel shader effects which composite several texture layers, we are able to achieve the impression of realistic churning clouds. In the offline previsualization work that we did to initially define this effect, we developed a very realistic simulation with more than 30 layers of clouds. With real-time shader techniques, we were able to achieve an equivalent look while maintaining an interactive frame rate. [Laughter, shouts] [Doug Wood] We intended White Forest to offer a change of pace from the constant action that preceded it-a few moments to reunite with old friends and get to know Dr. Magnusson, a breather before the big battle ahead. However, our first version of the sequence was a log-jam of long, talky scenes. Gordon and Alyx stood around listening to Kleiner and Magnusson argue at the top of the silo, then rode an elevator to the bottom of the shaft while Dr. Kleiner lectured them about rockets and satellites. They wandered into a control room to watch Dr. Mossman's transmission, and then hatched a plan to get her back. We knew we were in trouble when even the authors of the scene were bored, and no one had patience for the revelations that followed. We divided the sequence into a number of smaller pieces that could be interleaved with solitary exploration and some combat. This required rebuilding the path and moving the control room upstairs, where the transmission scene became a reward for surviving the secondary silo. As a result of these changes, the White Forest experience is more varied, the narrative comes in digestible portions, and players are able to play at their own speed, rather than being led by the nose the entire time. Now... now, it's still too early to celebrate. Finally. One down. [vort speak] Hey, stay focused! Get to cover and start shootin! [death sounds] That should have done it. Let's go see if the forcefield's down. Oh, oh I must I must get control of myself. Oh, deep breaths, deep breaths. [Flechette impact] Nothing's gonna happen to me. Seems deserted. Let's not waste any more time. We need to call White Forest. [Magnusson Device Created] We'd better get moving... You can use this. Indeed. Thank you, Gordon. Take the Freeeman, yes! Combine! Feel free to look around, Gordon. [Creaking metal] Got one. [breath] Here, Gordon, you could use this! Agreed! Turret, Doc! We'll never get past those things. We have to get rid of them. What you have there young lady, is the specific contact code for the Combine Overworld. Agreed! Marvelous Well, come on. The Freeman can make use of this. If you don't mind, I'd feel better if you had a look. [Kelly Bailey] This steam jet is an example of something we call a 'mechanic refresher'. It is meant to refresh the player's memory on how to perform a certain task they may not have used in a while. In this case, we remind the player about using valves to turn off steam in a relaxed environment. In the map just ahead, this trick will be fresh in their mind and they will be far more likely to realize they can use steamjets tactically when they encounter them in a combat situation. Yeah, I knew, I knew it, I was just tryin' to scare you, Sheck. But somebody's been here recently... I wonder who. Perhaps the Freeman can restore this elevator's functionality. Forward, Freeman! To the nectarium! What's that? It's right here, Dr. Kleiner. Halt. This place must have been nice once. Free-man! Free-man! Free-man! The Alyx Vance cannot remain corporeal for much longer. Incoming at 36! I'm sure the Combine haven't forgotten about us. Reclaim the Vortessence! These antlions will not let us proceed in peace. [Eric Twelker] In order to train players that crouching through the trenches is critical for survival, we did several things. First, we start the player in the safe position by forcing them to crouch under the fence to enter the area. Once inside, they learn by watching the zombies. Upright zombies are gunned down, but their torsos are free to roam in the shadow of the junk. Some playtesters believed that while the guns were busy shooting zombies, they would be able to move freely; to counteract this impression, we increased the number of guns from one to three, making it clear that there was always going to be a gun free to shoot the player. It's like the First Days all over again. I'll be waiting for you. Oh, it's nothing, honey. Maybe you can find a way to get this gate open. [Laughter, shouts] The last thing on my mind was submitting it for the Kleiner certificate of approval. Just lean into me. They're like striders... but smaller. Hey there Freeman. Eli Vance. Hold on, Gordon! Did you feel that? Careful now. Excellent, Gordon! Freeman, it would be good to counteract the lift's recalcitrance, that we may proceed. Gracious! Nobody's home. She wanted to stay with us but I needed her to keep an eye on him. Dad! Look out! [Danika Wright] Turning the vortigaunt into an expressive character was a challenge for animators, given that he doesn't have what you'd call a traditional face. To bring out his personality, the animators concentrated on shifting bodyweight and broad hand gestures. Most importantly, where human characters tend to move their heads a lot for emphasis, we concentrated his performances on expressive spinal motions. [struggle sounds.] Hello, is anyone there? Another strider coming in towards the sawmill wreckage. [Matt Rhoten] Originally there was a second driving section between the chopper battle and the autogun trenches. The pacing felt wrong, so we decided to remove it and connect the end pieces, so that the trainyard opens directly into the garage. Hello? We might not have much time to talk, even if you do restore the power. Should I leave some for you Griggs, huh? Uh oh. Strider coming in from the cranes. Our peers at Aperture Science were at work on a project of some promise, but in their rush to beat Black Mesa for funding, they must have compromised ordinary standards of risk. We heard their research vessel had simply disappeared. Vanished-with all hands... even part of the dry dock! [Dog vocalization] The house is surrounded. Putting words in her mouth. Yes, I know! But the Combine, they're heading your way! Freeman, we must strike forth! To the lift, Freeman! Protect the Alyx Vance! The radar's pointing right at this van. It's all of our fight, Dad. what else was on his agenda. I'm ready for them this time! Gordon, can you take care of that gun? The life of Alyx Vance is in our keeping! [pain sounds] Gordon? Launch the rocket, Gordon! We gotta get moving. [vort attack sounds] Freeman, go now. Ah, Freeman! We are doomed. This is... There it is. Well, Gordon, Gordon, hide. We've got to take the car if we want to beat the Combine to White Forest. We should get our warning out and then keep moving. Oh! Roadkill Watch the windows! Forbear, Freeman. Mm hmm. Sounds like a plan. The Guardian bars our way, but now we are free to destroy it. The sheer bulk of this machinery suggests a brute force solution. Just as soon as this is wrapped up. The data, people, the data! at which point we can test the stability of the system I knew it would end like this. Just launch the damn thing! [Matt Wright] This cave was originally designed with a pit in the middle, so the player could punt antlions into it with the gravity gun. In playtest sessions, however, very few of our playtesters actually used it in this way. The pit stayed in the room, but we changed the path to allow the player to descend into it and come back out. Pretty simple, eh, Doc? Wow. I'm sure Dr. Mossman is all right. Why are there so many? The car's ready, Freeman. Alyx is waiting inside. Hey doc, you cover 12! We're keeping an eye on it. [Laughter, shouts] Bastards!!! Crap. Well, yes, there's always a risk, Eli. I believe I've just learned the meaning of the phenomenon described as feverish anticipation It is good now that we work together. I'm going after her. Freeman, we cannot proceed while the Guardian yet lives. We made it! This is serious, Doc. I need to show you how the defense system works before the next attack. Stinkin' bugs! Hey, eat this. They went to a lot of trouble to lock this place up. Doctor Kleiner briefed me on everything he learned from the data packet One device at a time is sufficient, Freeman. And not a moment too soon. We recommend the Freeman for this task. There must be something more the Freeman can do! Go, Freeman. Uh, Gordon... It'll be the Seven Hour War, all over again. none dare bank upon it. [Gate lifted] You think the Combine found them? [Metal creaking] For the safety of the base, these devices are deactivated. Get here as quickly as you can, you two. [pain sounds]Help me... [Metal creaking] Combine over there! No! Ah, let's not forget that with the Magnusson device, those striders practically destroy themselves. But the route is bound to be hazardous. But if we can acquire a signature from the data you brought back, Fall back and defend the silo! [Vortigaunts chanting] Antlions! [to self]I'm gonna make it. I am gonna make it. [Railcar impact] Fantastic, Freeman! I hope they're still using this frequency. Uh... so weak... I suggest we adjourn this meeting of the mutual admiration society until after we have launched our rocket. [Marc Laidlaw] If you listened closely to the vortigaunts in the antlion tunnels, you may have heard one of them using a complaint very similar to Dr. Magnusson's here. Their affinity to Dr. Magnusson has caused some of his mannerisms to spread among them by way of their lowgrade telepathy. I guess it's time to rebuild the sawmill. Let's hit the road! What a nut. Must be soldiers from White Forest. [pain sounds]Gordon... One light... Oh my god. Such is mortality. [Phil Co] The breach is a rough, earthen tunnel which many playtesters tended not to notice when the attack began. They felt they had been told to defend only the three marked tunnel openings. We addressed this confusion by changing the sequence of antlion waves so that the second attack came through the breach. Players then understood that all four opening were vulnerable. If it's working, we need to send a warning to White Forest. We got 24! Oh my God! Our guns aren't cutting it. Not crows, people! Combine! Dog! You know what I'd give for a shower? I'd give you up to the Combine! Just kidding. Freeman! [John Morello] Griggs and Sheckley's comment about not stepping on the grubs was originally intended for comedic effect and to suggest that, as usual, Gordon Freeman had brought trouble in his wake. However, we found that some players took this comment too literally, and would spend the rest of the level avoiding grubs in fear of spawning more antlions. We experimented for a short time with making this an actual mechanic, bringing in antlions whenever grubs were squished; but this had several negative results: It made the tunnels far too difficult, and cancelled out any benefit the player got from squishing grubs for health. We decided to keep the grub behavior simple and rewarding. Better get moving, Doc. Follow the Vort. Yes, and Gordon too. We're okay - we made it out of City Seventeen. [vort calls] you can give him the full tour later, magnusson Whoa...dizzy... Freeman will to the hard work. Accept a charge. Ah shit! Wow, the radar is going crazy! Yeah. And now... I'm in here! Ahah! No pit would be complete without a Freeman climbing out of it. Duck! In every nest, there is a great nectarium where the creatures store their most precious glandular extract. [Bridge breaking] You'll find the sawmill at the far end of the valley! We'll take 36! Yikes! We sure did! We gotta get outta here! [sigh] there's no way you could know. Get those turrets back on their feet! [pain sounds] The transmitter room has to be around here somewhere. Get up! What's it doing? If they get close enough for one good shot at the silo What the hell makes you think that? [Vortigaunt dispel attack] Closer, Freeman! Don't go too far! We went as fast as we could. Throw a log at those hunters! What do you say, Gordon? Eight... and not too long ago. No, Dog! You're supposed to let us win! I must not be interrupted. [Lars Jensvold] In this brief transmission scene, we are restating the goals of the level, while introducing a note of uncertainty and developing Dr. Magnusson's character. This scene was not strictly necessary, but it helped players feel some connection to Magnusson when they finally reached White Forest and met him in person for the first time. In earlier versions, we tried having the Hunters cut the power and interrupt the transmission, but this felt arbitrary, and players were more receptive to the scene after they had solved the power puzzles and survived hunter combat. It feels like a small reward in addition to the simple satisfaction of beating the Hunters. Come on, Gordon, the chopper's waiting for us. [vort attack sounds] Her state is delicate. [breath] Over here! [Tom Leonard] The Hunter's escort behavior includes specific formations and flanking strategies. This environment was designed specifically to enhance those behaviors by providing cover and visually interesting paths. In this way the environment reinforces the design of the Hunter as stealthy, aggressive, and intelligent. Gordon... Man, you made it! Thank God. Yes, Magnusson, it just needs a little bit longer! That condition will not last long if you plunge into the toxins below. Where the devil have you gotten to? Gordon! The car's ready! Come on back and we'll get going! [Latch sound] I have disabled them. Take a look over here. I'll show you the set-up. Well...even so... [Merle Dandridge] I don't think I really got the full scope of what Alyx Vance is or how she's created until the first time I went to Valve headquarters. And what was really important was that I got a better idea of how big the team was. I mean, a lot of people work really hard to make Alyx Vance who she is. You hear my voice and it's easy to say, That's Alyx or Jamil is Alyx. But that is so not the case. These people spend hours in front of their computer or writing their scripts or dreaming up this beautiful person, and I'm just the cake topping really. One more down! Swarm at 24! The wire's coming out of this building, Gordon. Every man for himself. Every man for himself. Why isn't the decoding finished? Thank you, baby. Lead on. That was probably a scouting party. Aim for the device! You've really got a way with those Magnussons! Use caution, Freeman. [vort pain] Over here Griggs. Hustle it. When I remarked that with the Magnusson Device the striders would destroy themselves, I was speaking figuratively. We had a feeling you were close when we saw Dog take off like that. [Gary McTaggart] The launch of Magnusson's rocket ties directly into the rocket Gordon launched at Black Mesa. Here, the portal satellite array that opened a gate to Xen in Half-Life One has been repurposed to shut the Combine out. This is just another example of the way we constantly try to weave the old threads of the Half-Life story into the new episodes. [Hunter shielded] Come on Gordon, get in. No... Are you from the city? Dr. Freeman, over here! The portal's close to opening, but Dr. Magnusson's sure we'll be in time to stop it.  [quiet laughs] [John Cook] In this vista, we release the player from the confines of the subterranean world and thrust them into a vast open space on a scale rarely seen in our previous games. The narrative takes advantage of this scale as well. With our allies at close range and our enemies on the distant bridge, we are reminded of the personal stakes and the larger threat, all in one short scene. That seals it. We're dead! [Merle Dandridge] It means a lot to me to have a multi-ethnic heroine. When I was growing up, that didn't happen a whole lot. Maybe Storm from X-Men? It wasn't commonplace. So to have someone that's my type be in that kind of position is really amazing. I think it's a popular trend now, but that wasn't always the case. Simple as vorting squits in a volasill. [pain] Step on it! [vort speak] They're going after Alyx! But we don't know for sure--- Let's go in. [struggle sounds.] Forward! Freeman! The more I think about that warning from our friend, the more I'm convinced it has to do with Borealis. Stop right there, honey. You're almost there! I hate my life. Oh boy, here we go! [Garage door open] you remember alyx don't you? More at the breach! [struggle sounds.] They're still tracking us. [Unknown creature sounds] You must draw their aggression so I can hurry her to shelter. [vort chanting] Healing her will require more than I alone can conjure. [pain] [Mike Blasczak] In previous versions of this level, the platform opened directly into this pit of toxic waste. Playtesters who didn't recognize the waste as something harmful, would jump straight into the pit. We changed the path so the player could make a safe landing and slowly come to understand the toxic threat. Strider at the sawmill. White Forest, come in. We're all tired, Freeman, but you can't just sit around here. Follow the Vort! [Launch doors fully closed] That should keep the Freeman safe. [Engine rev] Oh, they're inseparable. Truly, the Freeman leaves no path unexplored. That thing was hurt. Did you see it? Prepare to merge with the void. Now as soon as you get here with the signature data, we'll encode the satellite and get the damn thing into orbit. [Vortigese expressions of shock:] Oh no! It's quiet...too quiet. Downstairs! We're getting close. Striderrr! Oh shit, the whole place is lit up. Grab a tunnel! Okay... I'll cover you from here. Whoa! [pain] [Web impact] Thanks, Gordon! Yes, he's fine. If you're looking for the sawmill, it's thataway! I don't suppose you've got any tools for working on cars? Whoa! And 36! Well, of course they have. You see, Kleiner, it's the linchpin of all of their plans. Remember, keep em distracted while Freeman takes em down! Whoa! A wind from below bears the scent of extract. The stuff we seek lies at the bottom of this pit. Gordon, hold up a second... You will just have to wait until after the launch. I tweaked your onboard radar so that Combine show up red on the dashboard unit now. Portal storms! I can't get over this I knew it would end like this. Health over here! To Freeman! For a moment, indeed, you were. Get him, Dog! I need you over here. Your energies require our assistance, Freeman. We must see to it that they remain so. Yeah! Freeman! Keep your eye on the lights! If you would take the Freeman from here I can return to my place of honor at the side of the Magnusson. [struggle sounds.] ah, this should do it. but with everything she put us through We... we have lift-off. All right. A moment longer... Don't let em near your head. This car can sure take some abuse. Help awaits us, in the mines. Well, Gordon. I guess it's all up to you. We're holding the lift for you, Gordon. Ah... You had me worried there. This one is untethered. [pain] my dear, what do you mean? Aim for the Hunters! Griggs, over there! Now knock out that energy ball. [pain] Attention! Attention, personnel! This is Dr. Magnusson. We are experiencing a breach of internal base defenses. Please bear with us while we pinpoint the location of the breach. You idiot, So what happens next? Success! Wait... What is this? You all right down there? Is Dog okay? Well, see, in the city...the place was lousy with AR3s. Destroy all obstacles! Ah... And 36! The way is unbarred. Just so Pick your turret up! Think it's worth looking at? Ah, it is a pity the guardians are out of season. No pheropods. Something's in the front room! [Throbbing pulse] Freeman, it is time! Well, we should keep moving. We sure as hell didn't use guns. We would just wrestle Hunters to the ground with our bare hands. I used to kill ten-twenty a day, just using my fists. [sobbing] Freeman, I'm going to assume you are in the secondary silo and able to hear me. Thanks. It's good to be here. Once we have the extract, we can rejoin them quickly, provided we can restore elevator function. We shall proceed by another path! Blip. We'd never have known this was here without the beacon. but suddenly I'm Ah no! Well, I'll see everyone back at base. I see you too appreciate the larval pellet's properties! We're off! Oh brother. Our delay--regrettable. Yes, yes, I can see you are on to something! Let's go back upstairs. Dr. Kleiner needs you but I have a feeling I'm lucky to be here. I don't think rebels have been here for a while. Will you be ok here? [Autocannon Shot!] Shh. [vort speak] You ok doc? [sniff] If it tries to hinder our progress, we will have no choice but to kill it. [Skidding sounds] Hey, Doc What do you think, Gordon? [Metal creaking] [vort speak] Gordon, you coming? What? Gordon, we should get going. Catch this, Gordon! [Cave crickets] Now when you get back, we've got a lot to talk about. [Erik Johnson] Every Half-Life game so far has started with Gordon Freeman weaponless. Assuming some players had just played through Episode 1, while others might not have played it at all, we had to decide how long we should spend parcelling out new weapons and providing adequate time to play or practice with each one. In this case, we decided to hand the player a number of weapons all at once, figuring most would have mastered their gunplay in previous episodes. We held off doing a lot of deliberate training until we began introducing newer modes of combat later in the episode. Watch out for the hunters! Well, Freeman. [Jason Holtman] When the vortigaunt discovers the extract, we wanted to do something to distinguish the nectar from all the other glowy alien substances we've seen in the caves so far. Therefore we had him perform a bit of a chant, and had the extract give off a show of its own. [Merle Dandridge] A question I get asked a lot is, 'What is the big difference between acting for stage and film and then acting for a videogame?' Because this is the first time I've ever done a videogame. In general, in acting, it's helpful to have a director's clear vision from which to spring. Then the actor can run with the idea, play with it, imagine new things, fill it out and make it a tangible thing or a tangible character. And the great thing about videogame acting for me is that I'm completely unlimited. I'm not bound by what I can do physically or how I look or what kind of environment can be physically created. So the possibilities are completely limitless. There are no boundaries with this. So when we get together and we talk about what the scene is, when they set the stage for me and what environment I'm going to be in, I immediately get a complete high. And I can only imagine it is something like how somebody gets when they actually see the game, because it blows my mind, the pictures that they paint, about where we are, what situations we're in. So we discuss that a little and then from there we just kind of go on, I guess instinct is the only way I can really describe it, because I take what they give to me and kind of volley it back in the way that it comes out immediately. So I just go into my little dark booth and I can imagine that I'm anywhere. And it's the best--the best kind of make-believe for a storyteller, when you just aren't limited. Oh man...I hope that was the last of em. Except this time we won't last seven minutes. I'm gonna miss you. [Forest creatures] Goddamn it, TAKE IT DOWN! Time to launch that rocket, Gordon. [Engine idle] We must attend to the Alyx Vance. I know, I know. She said something about an installation. [Radar ping: Friendly] Now, Eli... The only thing worse than Judith falling into their hands would be if they should get a hold of you. She may know the particulars of the Borealis, but you...you know everything about the resistance! The resonator seems to be taking hold. The breach again! That supercharged ammo for your AR2 will kill hunters with one shot! So what happens next? Good. Maybe I can get this open... You have my word on it! [pain] The vort says as long as we don't step on their grubs, they shouldn't hear us this far from the nest... Hurry! Hey Sheck, am I gonna have to kill all of these myself? The guardian is enraged over our theft of the extract. It's like an on-board radar for you guys. Picks up little beacon jobbers like this one here. Attention, attention, all personnel. Has anyone seen Lamarr? If the Combine were here, they've moved on. Here, I'll get this field down. Better get moving, Doc. Follow the Vort. I have learned to ignore such naysayers when quelling them was out of the question. So, that's what we saw in the Citadel. Where's Alyx? [vort attack sounds] Gordon! Take a look, Gordon. If you can hear me, Freeman, for god's sake close the overhead silo doors! We'd better hurry up. Magnusson will lose it if he thinks we were fooling around. Yeah, well, about that... Oh my God! [Ominous sounds] [Q!] Early in the development for this level, we used an animation for Alyx that showed her as clearly injured as she ran along behind the player. This really slowed her down, however, and playtesters did not enjoy waiting for her to catch up, or going back to retrieve her. To address this, we started her recovery in the preceding map to make sure she was healthy enough to run at regular speed before reaching this area. Guard yourself against the corrosive spray! Oh man, not Freeman. They must've brought in every strider on the continent! Maybe we should see what it's picking up. Get back to your car! [Nick Maggiore] The scene where Alyx sees the Hunters for the first time since her injury was meant to be a turning point for her as a character, and an emotional highlight of the episode, both for Gordon and for Alyx. One reason we had a hunter injure Alyx in the beginning of the episode was so that she could have a strong emotional reaction to the creatures, and use the start of combat as a way of building a good character moment. Alyx's previous encounter has given her a visceral fear of hunters, but now she has to make a conscious choice to get past her fear and into the right state for fighting them. She uses anger to get there. We also use Alyx's intensity to draw the player's attention to subtler aspects of the scene-getting the player in position for the best view of the hunters as the attack gets underway. Lamarr? Uh oh... [Brian Jacobsen] Dr. Magnusson was the result of a decision to bring forward another signature character from the original Half-Life, along the lines of Dr. Kleiner and Barney. As we developed the character, we kept referring back to this line from Half-Life to keep us on track: [Play HL1 audio clip here]. Though we liked the character who came into focus, we found that this voice was sounding like too much of a caricature for our increasingly grim and realistic world. We like to hire actors with the natural voices that we want for our characters, as opposed to hiring actors to create voice characterizations. In John Aylward, we found someone who could deliver the brusque arrogance of the original lines, and also take the character forward into some of the richer and subtler opportunities we foresee for him. I'm ready for you. Alyx! I'd really like to get a look in there. From afar, they squirt their acid! Gordon... We have a trap door up here where I can let you over to the other side. Oh...Antlions...you sure I didn't die and go to hell? [quiet laughs] North? Hey doc, you cover 24! [Cave ambience] we fully expect this to be a glorious and transcendent moment for human civilization. [Engine into reverse] We're so close I can almost hear Dr. Magnusson. So have you ever used an AR2 before? Yeah! I knew it was too good to last. The Freeman knows best. The Freeman will please accompany us. You okay in there? No pulse! Come on, this way. Here's a medkit doc. We'll take the breach! You're not serious? The carapace. Freeman. Uh...my God... [Torsten Zabka] Zombies serve the double purpose of horror and humor. Here, since we knew where the player's view would be, we added a comical scene of a fast zombie torso running away from a soldier. [pain] [vortigese] here [Fan sound] [pain] Well what are you waiting for Freeman, a hug? I cannot hear you. [Marc Scaparro] Playtesters often failed to recognize that they could scramble through windows while they were avoiding being shot by the autogun. We added this window exit, and forced players to use it so they would learn to rely on windows to get around. Huh. Satellite payload powered and ready... I confess, I...had my doubts. Lamarr? I think we've seen the last of the Combine! We should have beat their asses years ago! [vortigese] [to self]All right, all right. You're gonna be fine. [vort chanting] Gordon, let's go! Listen--it's on the roof! Hey, I know that peak! You can see it from White Forest! Behold! Across the chasm! What did you say? The portal has been neutralized! [Elevator car falling] Push the damn button, Gordon! Don't give up, Freeman! You're doing great! [Creaking metal] Maybe we should just head out. We need to get to White Forest. I hope that's the last one for a while. If I die, the Alyx Vance is lost! she took a small crew and flew north... shortly after we flew to white forest. [Tree crashes] Lamarr? Ah, Gordon Freeman! [Gear Engages] Careful up there. That was close! All right! Only one more! The Freeman's cord is cut. I expected you hours ago. After you, Gordon. You mind if I wait with the car? Zombies! I got 'em! And 24! Still, I am not one to squander my investments... Look at 'em go! If you're waiting for the Combine's go-ahead, they'll soon be here to give it to you in person! We can hold 'em off! She ebbs! I will follow the Freeman when I can. There's no call for hurtful comments. Oh my God! No. They must be stopped! I'm sorry we couldn't get here any sooner, Dad. Assuming Kleiner decoded it correctly. [Striderbuster fizzles out] My place is here. Get away from the door! Sorry, heh. [vort chanting] Yeah! Take a medkit. My kin will meet us at a sheltered location beneath the surface. Give it a throw. Are you sure? There's a hot plate in the old staff room. uh-huh. Noooo! [Blast doors begin closing] Freeman - follow and quickly! I'm with ya, I'm with ya. Yeah, yeah, I think Gordon gets the idea. Strider! [Skidding sounds] [Advisor Chatter] [laugh] if we knew the signal characteristics we could selectively block combine access while allowing ourselves to teleport freely. Try to outrun it! Rest of the gang's up north by the old sawmill-here.  Ahoy, Freeman. The door! [Sounds of wordless awe] I feel certain that when Defend the base, people! Don't let 'em near the base! Now...hm... Hey, can you figure out a way to get this gate open? I'll follow you. [vort chanting] Aren't you gonna see us off? The Freeman must move. Clear that roof so I can get a shot! Run it over! I'll catch up with you later. [laugh] [Cave ambience] Hey! If you would take the Freeman from here I can return to my place of honor at the side of the Magnusson. Freeman. [sobbing] Good luck out there Damn these mines! [Chet Faliszek] In Half-Life 2, when we first decided to make vortigaunt ally characters, we played around with having a prominent vortigaunt companion. Because of their bowed posture and semi-servile manner, this individual was dubbed Heep, after the Dickens character Uriah Heep. In episode 2 we named the prominent vort at the white forest base Uriah. In episode 3 we will find out Dicken's unused middle name for Uriah Heep. Race you to the base! [Erik Wolpaw] Aperture Science, being specialized in the development of portal technology, fit naturally into the cosmology of Half-Life. Rather than forcing Portal into the Half-Life franchise, we used it as an opportunity to make our world bigger. By suggesting a long-term rivalry between Aperture Science and Black Mesa, we open up possibilities in both games that didn't exist when they were separate entities. I'm glad you're on our side. Dr. Magnuisance, I call him. That's why he sent me out here. [Thwack!] Fear not, Freeman, for I follow! Yeah, that's trouble all right. We're fine! [sobbing] [pain] [Skidding sounds] Come close... This could be Combine handiwork... [Gray Horsfield] This swirling debris effect uses much of the same underlying technology that powers other cinematic physics events in episode 2, but with a few important differences. Firstly, instead of using primitives, every slat, tile and beam was modeled before being sent into the rigid body solver. Next, there was a large focus on handsculpting world forces to achieve a particular behavior in the debris. Beyond the basics of gravity and collisions, we created spiral vortices, gravity wells, and some other more complex forces. With over 1800 individually calculated dynamic moving parts over a 30 second period, this simulation represents the largest amount of animation data run through our game engine to date. Ware, Freeman! My head! I have to fix the car if we are going to have any chance of outrunning the combine.  Now, how soon can you get here? Good luck out there That looks like a bunker entrance up ahead. Freeman! Send up the elevator! Well find Judith and bring her back, For the cause of the All-in-One. I'll fill Gordon in on the way. Oh my rocket! Oh my rocket works! Ah... This'll work. [death sounds] Although it seems counterintuitive, I believe we must ascend to reach the nectarium. There goes the new radar panel. Hunters! Hunters... I don't like it. [sobbing] [Jay Stelly] Although this bridge is not the first occasion for cinematic physics in the episode, it was the original test subject we used to develop our effects. In early prototypes, the bridge started off in its broken position--it was a static object the player had to navigate to retrieve the car. When we incorporated the cinematic physics, we thought this bridge would be a great opportunity for players to see an immense piece of the environment transformed before their eyes. The bridge collapse not only showcases the cinematic physics, it reminds players of the growing threat from the superportal, and sets up a navigational puzzle they must use the car to solve. God knows we'll have plenty of time. [Hunter sounds] Come to me! Safe at last! I'll stay here. [sobbing] Well that tears it. Freeman, thank you. I won't take that chance. [Laughter, shouts] Holy shit! Put us down! But my goodness, we have coordinates...blueprints...hailing frequencies... Looks like that was the last one---Wait a minute! Get ready, everyone! We've spotted dropships carrying even more striders! We have about a minute before they hit, so gear up! This is going to get ugly before it's over. [sigh...] What those loafers back there would call your gravity gun. The Freeman has done his task magnificently! and I remain confident she was worth far more than the initial... Generators... power.. What more do we need? [pain] Strider! [Yahn] This is an instance where observing playtests gave us ideas for tuning the experience. In an early version, playtesters would trigger the lights to go out and the zombies to wake up. Then, they would run out of the room and close the door. After seeing this repeatedly, we added a trigger allowing the zombies to open the door and chase the player. All in one and one in all. [Laughter, shouts] Don't look. Alyx is right in there, Dr. Freeman. [Greg Coomer] Before we simplified the path through the guardian's lair, we allowed a right turn at this junction, leading the player right back to where they began. One of our playtesters continued to repeatedly turn right here for half an hour. That was a compelling argument for removing the mazelike elements. Okay! [Iestyn Bleasdale-Shepherd] We wanted to create a tension between Gordon and the antlion guardians that would develop over several levels and only resolve out here in the open. In order to differentiate this guardian from others the player had encountered throughout Half-Life 2 and Episode One, we changed his texture to a glowing green. This gave the player the satisfaction of revenging himself on the creature that had chased him through the underground lair. Aim for the Mag Device! Hey, Doc...spare gun here if you want it. They're back! Get that thing! This is rather unlike him. Cuttin' it pretty close, Gordon! Hey doc. Protect us! well I can't let him in My dear, what a relief--not to mention a delight--to see you here at last! [vort calls] Striders! Approaching the silo! I was never so glad to see him, believe me. Hey, it's Gordon Freeman! No wonder! Now to the next matter of urgency. Actually Alyx, would you mind getting me a cup of tea? Telemetry data links. [Metal impact] Medkit! Looks like we're in for a detour. Swarm at the breach! [Hunter charge impact] You all right down there? Is Dog okay? Now, check this map. Pity the generator that requires a vortigaunt to operate it. We're not going anywhere. Refugees... Ah - here we go. Here have a medkit. Ah! Ah! AH! AH! AH! Out in the field? I'm not going out in the field. I'm a radio operator. A strider has been spotted by the cranes. Save your skills in melee for less explosive enemies. [Lift stops] I am with you, Freeman! Whoa! I'd like to know what they're up to. Did we do it? Was that it? Somebody please tell me that was all of them! The door! Cover the door, Gordon! Doesn't look like the power is ever coming on again Don't listen to him, Doc. Oh crap! Keep it up, Doc! unfortunately, it's impossible to do more than guess at that portal's specific signature. Oh cool. The Freeman is a quick thinker and fast mover. I hate those freakin things! Remember, do not kill the guardian or the extract will be ruined! [Bridge creaking, collapsing] I just hope they got my warning. [Unknown creature sounds] All the more reason to give it a closer look. Magnificent device, isn't it? Here come zombies. Protect the vort! We'll send him over. Look alive! Let's get out of here! The colors on this head don't run you bastards. [Acid Spit] We go willingly. [Ido Magal] One problem we faced in this map was that players would abandon their car in the heat of battle and not be able to find it later. Given the time pressure and large scale of the map, some of these players couldn't succeed in protecting the base on foot. To address this we started by adding flashing hazard lights to the car, which helped when the car was in view, but we still saw players lose the car among the trees or behind hills. Eventually we added a vehicle locator to the player's HEV suit, so players could find the car wherever it was. Use that Combine pulse ammo against em, Freeman! Almost vortal, this bond between you... Sometimes I like to get Magnusson mad just for the fun of it. Course, it's not much of a challenge. Best of luck, you two. You know who I'm talking about. You ready Freeman? We're all tired, Freeman, but you can't just sit around here. Follow the Vort! Reloading! Outstanding! Let's go! What was that? Oh my god! I'll bet it's the Combine portal code! I think that was the last hunter. Freeman, striders are coming. Just find her, Izzy While one survives, so live we all. Alert. [sobbing] I'm sorry. Already closed out launch support equipment checklist... See ya! YES! Freeman, beware the pits. Hey...an extra pair of hands. Dog, good, you made it. And gordon freeman certainly needs no introduction. I am serious, leave. Great shot! Hey, look! [vort pain] Let's hope this still works Shoot the Mag Device! We've had enough surprises for one day. Heed well the Magnusson's words. at which time it would be too late to prevent reinvasion. You two really should get going. Whoa! [Nick Maggiore] The barn scene was critical both to this episode and to the development of Advisors as characters in the series. They represent another intersection of story and gameplay concerns. This is the first time the player actually interacts with an Advisor, and determining the right level of interactivity was tricky, especially given the player's reasonable expectation that he'll get to fight them directly at some point. Therefore, we wanted to show that they were powerful but not invulnerable. This was a long-term goal. For the short term, we wanted to get the player familiar with some Advisor behavior so that when the episode finale occurred, they would already understand how Advisors operate. By showing the Advisor fumbling with an inert object, then a dead rebel, and finally grabbing the player, we allow the player to observe behavior, and then gradually make it more and more of a direct threat. This all serves as foreshadowing for the episode's finale. [Hunter pain sound] Let's go, Sheck. The basement! I fear a more urgent errand demands our attention:  Well, you gonna push the button? We did. Back in the Citadel...those things we saw... Keep after it! Watch out for the hunters! At last! [Vortigaunt dispel attack] We did it, Gordon! [struggle sounds.] This way and quickly. [Strider vocalization] [Advisor Chatter] Excellent shooting! Doctor Kleiner and my Dad are up north at an old missile base. [Advisor transmission] I follow the Freeman! Hey, Doc, time for that later. The Freeman's plan is working! Excuse me. I'll be right over here when you are ready to head out. We need to stop em here! [Forklift start] [Jason Mitchell] In the Source engine, we use a realistic radiosity lighting simulator to generate lighting detail for the geometry in our game worlds. In previous games using the Source engine, shadows were simulated as if cast by totally opaque objects. In Episode 2, we needed to render large wooded areas, which required us to modify our shadowing technology to account for the sparse, semi-transparent nature of foliage. With these upgrades to our radiosity lighting simulator, we are now able to realistically illuminate the trees themselves as well as generate soft semi-transparent shadows on the environment around them. Enough. [struggle sounds.] We have survived worse across the ages. my biggest mistake was forgetting how persuasive he can be. I got this one! I hear things are better back in the city. Hit it! Hunters! [Hunter charge] Exceptional. I only hope our dreams do not follow them.  [Taylor Sherman] Our playtesters loved to see the zombie jump on the front of the car, and this naturally encouraged us to want to do more of it. We started off with a high frequency of occurrences of this behavior, treating the zombie leap as a gameplay element that could be played out in variations. Eventually, though, we discovered that this didn't lead to any really interesting gameplay, so we ended up creating just one memorable showcase of the event instead. We're drivin' here! These mines are killing us. [Acid antlion spits] Lead us. [vortigese] Quite ingenious of Dr. Mossman, to hide it all in the carrier wave. Let Freeman handle the mines! [Steve Bond] We made some small changes to our autosave system as a result of tuning the final strider battle. Autosaves are the periodic checkpoints where we can restart the player's game after death, so that they don't have to worry about replaying more of the game than necessary. In playtests, we observed that most players depended on our autosaves to restart after dying, rather than using their own quick-saves. But because the fight allowed players so much freedom, some players ended up with an autosave that left them in a no-win situation. Low on health and pinned down by hunters, or too far from the base to defend the rocket in time, some players failed thirty or more times before finally giving up. To address the no-win situation, we extended our autosave system to monitor health over time, and to only perform the autosave if the player was deemed safe for a reasonable period of time. We also prohibited autosaves when striders were within a certain distance of the base; this ensured there was always enough time to defeat them. Finish the goddamn thing! Forget it... Cover the vort! But how...how shall we descend? [Power Off] I said we should expropriate that hazard suit and give it to Doctor Mossman. Maybe now they'll listen to me. [pain] Protect us! Seems like a long shot but we have to try to get a signal. Ho-ly shit! Thank you, darling. thanks! Oh yes, quite real, despite its almost legendary stature. Those hunters don't do well against a well-aimed radiator! I may have just what you're looking for. Others of your kind less fortunate must have sheltered here. You handle the breach, Doc! There is no time to tarry! Why'd they stop shooting? Good work! You're almost to the car! The survival of Earth depends on the data you carry. Let me see about this. [Randy Lundeen] For most of this episode's development, there was a counterweight puzzle in this area--one the player had to solve while under attack by antlions. Although it was a clever puzzle, we felt that the underground experience was already long enough, so we removed it and streamlined the path to the nectar. Having too many obstacles made it hard to keep up the sense that recovering the nectar was an urgent task. Whoops. Nine... [Antlion grub sounds] Griggsy, don't get near the green lightning. Well, doesn't everyone have more important things to do than stand around? Well, okay... [Picked up larval pellet] Yeah. Way to go, Freeman! The Combine's falling back! Clear the field! White Forest personnel, please clear the field! we must ask all personnel to take cover immediately in order to ensure the vicinity is clear for launch The scent of ripe perfection beckons. If they start comin' out of more than one tunnel, we're cooked. Maybe we can take the knobs off the radio? Kapow To the lift, Freeman! There they are! Magnussons over here, Freeman! That's perfect We did it! Remember us. From your point of view, you merely pitch the device at the strider's hull, then blow it up. How're we going to get in there? Use your car, Freeman! Let's go check that power box again. It's like the First Days all over again. Lets go find out what we just powered up. I sure hope it was a transmitter. Let's head in there. We're history! There goes your paintjob! [vortigese] [moans] Hey Griggs, you might want to show Dr. Freeman where we keep all the supplies, huh? Hey, look up there! It's a radio tower. Hold still or we cannot charge you. They're not making this easy! [Hunter shield off] Let's check the other building. No! Come on, Gordon. Maybe we should have left that thing alone. Now, out in the field, we'll supply you with all the Magnusson Devices you need through delivery ports like this one. That's why I must now Why, his restless spirit embodies the very essence of scientific inquiry. Yeah! Manhacks! You gotta take those hunters out first! Wow! Wait'll I tell the gang I actually helped bail out Gordon Freeman! (chastened) I'll be quiet now. [Merle Dandridge] This final Episode 2 scene was...unbelievable. Before we even started working on it, the team sat me down, and they did a little show and tell of the animation they had. I think they were hesitant to show it to me but just from that rough animation I was so moved, I mean, immediately moved to tears. I felt like I had just been gut-punched and I immediately felt it, and I was like, let's go, let's get on this. It shouldn't surprise me by now because I've been working on Alyx for so long now, but every time we come to the table to do a new scene or to lay down some new material, I am always blown away, and this scene was the epitome of that feeling. I was so pumped to get in there and start working on it. They're always upping the ante and always taking it to the next level, but this time, this scene is different. Cause this time, Alyx loses. And I think this is a-I don't think, it is a major sacrifice. You see her carrying around the wounds of her mother that she lost, but her dad made her who she is. Her dad taught her, her dad groomed her, and I think most importantly-he loved her. This script was a gift and a gut-punch all in one. When you give me something like that, it really motivates me to try to knock it out of the ballpark. I love, love playing Alyx. I have to say, it's definitely my favorite acting job I've ever had-hands down. Uriah - set the target for close range practice. Gordon! Get away! We got 36! [vort pain] [vort attack sounds] Umm... [vort calls] Is there reason for delay? Gordon, we're not alone! Follow me If not...don't answer. [Chris Douglas] This crashed advisor pod is a bit of storytelling embedded in the landscape. It hints at what lies ahead, while suggesting what must have happened in this location only a few hours before Gordon and Alyx arrived. By placing artifacts of this sort throughout the episode, we slowly bring Advisors into the foreground and develop their importance to the story in a way that doesn't depend on staged dramatic scenes. Take that, Dumbass! We have learned to exterminate the acid-lions from a distance. Over there! Well, let's get outside. Here we go! It's dark down here. There's another one. [Gate open] These things can have my head when they chew it off my cold, dead neck. Go ahead. Gordon, we really need to get moving. I've got a rocket to launch. Yeah. Follow me. life support. I gotcha [struggle sounds.] We shall do our utmost to protect the Freeman. Freeman, attend. [Elan Ruskin] In Half-Life2 and Episode 1, players learned that turrets will always attack them unless they are reprogrammed by allies. We needed a new visual way to instantly show that these new turrets also are allies, and decided to hark back to the aircraft nose art of WW2. The elaborate turret design also hints at how bored Griggs and Sheckley must have been sitting down here by themselves. We should get moving. They need us at White Forest. It is the Freeman. I think we found our Advisor. That was it! Force field's down! Take care of yourself. There's the entrance! I though for sure I was dead. [death sounds] Now remember, Dog has strict orders to look after you. HAHAHA YEAH! Cover 36! Hey, Doc-I just wanted to say thanks. I was on that train you helped evacuate from City 17. Hark This will definitely send a clear message to the Combine. but she's paid the price We recommend silence. This is a weighty matter, well suited to a physicist of your stature. You've got him! while she acts as Well, that's good, because, well... Magnusson must've sent you, eh? [vortigese] Let's keep going, see if we can pick up the road somewhere ahead. We're gonna have to take out those guards, Gordon. The chopper's waiting for us. It's okay. Make haste! [Dog vocalization] Here he comes! Here comes Freeman! [Merle Dandridge] It constantly amazes me how many people are involved in creating her because everyone involved seems to have the same vision for her. And for so many people to have one mind about a character, it blows my mind. Very rarely do I get a piece of direction or script that doesn't ring true to how I feel about Alyx, and vice versa. And strangely enough, as soon as I try something out and something doesn't ring true, I'm usually not the first person to say it. Even though I might be feeling it, somebody else will say it. And it's just a testament to how in-tune everybody is about what kind of person Alyx is and what she would do, what she wouldn't do, what kind of girl she is. [sounds of struggle] Zombies! Get ready! And the Breach! [Turret destroyed] Oh god, strider! Since you brought that chopper in on your tail, you wanna maybe help us take it down? My kin are still some distance away. I'm beginning to think that something more ominous than crows is... Aim for the device! We can't hold out much longer. Such spittle-it burns. Gordon, go on! I'll follow when I can! Alyx? On my way. Advisors. What the hell? Hey, Doc-I just wanted to say thanks. I was on that train you helped evacuate from City 17. [pain sounds] Gordon Freeman. More lights means more antlions. [laugh] it appears gordon wishes to examine the so called spearhead missile. It is an honor to have been accepted among the Magnusson's staff. [Groan...] no no that's all right sweetheart Well, they'll be back soon. Gordon and I captured a raw data stream that was going out when the Citadel blew. The last time I heard those words was back at Black Mesa. [pain] Since I can't help you in there, why don't I stand outside while you disable the power cell? Let's get back to the car, Gordon. [Laugh] Yes. What you're seeing is the infancy of a superportal. The Freeman lives on in us. we're not coming back without her. They'll be there soon! I've always believed it a figure of speech Hey, this ain't so bad. We could be inside getting browbeat. Over there! There's so much I need to tell you. I'm sorry Dr. Magnusson. We let you down. If you're looking for the sawmill, it's thataway! They're not making this easy! We're gonna have to find a way around this anyway. The Freeman must beware! [struggle sounds.] Doctor Freeman. and then we can view it in the auxiliary control room. [vort attack sounds] Onward! Satisfaction. [Laugh] [Dog vocalization] [Advisor Chatter] Borealis Cover the door, Gordon. We had a feeling you were close when we saw Dog take off like that. Hurry, Freeman. I didn't see it. Oh dear... That turret's cooked. They're coming from 24 again! We couldn't have cut it any closer if that was our intention. Keep on, Freeman! Yes, take the Freeman, ah yes! [Engine off] [vort chanting] [vort attack sounds] [Tim Larkin] We sometimes use sounds to set a mood rather than to literally underscore the onscreen action. The G-Man sequence, for example, relies heavily on the use of abstract and ambient sounds. We wanted the soundscape to have the deadened, internalized quality you get from putting your hands over your ears, so we started with recordings from inside a womb. If you listen closely, you can hear internal gurgling noises as well as muffled heartbeats. We then added various other effects around the rythym of the heartbeat, plus long tailed reverb. None of the door or transition effects are literal interpretations, but are obscure metal and feedback sounds created to work in sync with the observable action. All of these things contribute to the scene's dreamlike quality. [Blast pulse] [Second gear] They move north with great purpose. We need to find the transmitter room, so we can contact White Forest and warn them the Combine are coming their way. Let's find the power supply for this forcefield. As you're so fond of pointing out This is it! [Gray Horsfield] The destruction of this rail bridge was our first opportunity to showcase our new cinematic physics technology. We wanted to convey to the player the scale of the train wreck and the delicate balance the damaged bridge was left in as a result. The structural deformation of the twisted metal was modeled with the help of surface based spring networks, driven by particle systems. In this case we actually passed a rail car through the bridge, and solved the deformation dynamically. For the collapse, we used an offline large scale rigid body simulation, a technology typically reserved for the visual effects industry. In this simulation we have about 750 moving parts, calculated with coarse convex hulls. These in turn drove a skeleton network, to which the high resolution geometry was skinned. Particles were then emitted from the transforming geometry and calculated in-game. Boy, are we glad to be here. I hope magnusson's provided for contingencies I hadn't noticed this before; rocks must have shifted when that shockwave hit. [Soft impact] Hey! It's off again! What'd you do? Like that? [sounds of struggle]Let me go! There's no controlling that kind of power! 24's lit up! [pained breathing] Yeah. Hey-something on the radar. [panting]Is that it? Well, stay tuned. Nice one, Freeman! Here they come! It's Alyx and Gordon Freeman! We've hidden a bunch of these things out there in the field to signal emergency stashes. There's got to be a transmitter around here, Gordon. [vort pain] Word to the wise, don't eat the k-rations. They put something in 'em to make you forget the suppression field's down. Something approaches. [out of breath] Dr. Freeman. I'm not a big fan of your work at Black Mesa, but you've been doing a bang-up job lately. Are you there? Your suit shows signs of stress, Freeman! Oof! Wait a moment... Magnusson said whatever you say, goes. [pain] [Weight impact on lift] It is but the blink of an eye. Help! Nooooooooo! We're finished So that's why nobody is here. Eyes of blue and three feet two. [Strider vocalization] Careful, Freeman, although far from clever, the antlions will ambush us where they can. once in place, it will block combine access to earth, even if they do manage to restore their portal network Freeman, the entrance to the mines is just ahead. Hey, somebody's waving us in. [Fourth gear] Yep, this is it. Hey, Doc! Over here. It came from downstairs. Well, we're close to White Forest, but I guess we'll have to leave the car, unless we can figure out a way to open this gate. That's right. [laugh] Thanks to the Magnusson. [Clank!] What did the Freeman expect to find down there? Direct contact with such a foe is hardly wise. For all of us. It's all over but the shouting! Finish it, Freeman! Whoa! Nice work with old blue eyes. The Freeman must be silent. Terrific! See if you can get it to come down, Gordon. Striders! Look at it go! Awesome Gordon- way to go! I don't think so. No it--- So, do you know what the alternative fire method does on the AR2? It kills hunters. How did you city folk kill hunters? I detect numerous host-parasites in the depths. [pain] I could use Gordon's assistance, if you could spare him. [Hunter smashes through Window!] Dear God...this has to work... Careful, ok When you see your father Yes Watch out. Press on to the nectarium! Look what it's doing to the bridge! That lift is too small to hold us both. Go on alone. I will join you when I can! And Gordon. I see you and the HEV suit have taken excellent care of each other. White Forest, come in. Over there--a gate. They're all over! Agreed! Gordon - there's something snooping around out here. Thanks for everything you've done. [pain sounds]Help me.. The signal's really weak... What the hell was that? Lift-off! Oh, it worked... it worked! Let's get back to the car. She's nothing if not resourceful. I think they're getting ready to storm the house. The Combine are nearly upon us. But by all means, take your time. [Blast pulse] Let us return now to the Alyx Vance. Gone. Watch this! Yeah! Dad! Well, let's find another way around. Dog? It is conceivable I can supply the power this gun lacks. Hey, I was drinking that! Now they're flyin' em in. Great. [moans] [Mumbling, unconscious moaning] We cannot summon the lift until the Guardian is dead. Whoa, what's that? Gotta reload. Incoming!!! [Skidding sounds] Hey, Doc, if you need a gun there's some down by the elevator. Plenty for all! [Antlion grub deathsqueak] But something really strange is happening with the Citadel. We've activated the resonator. No freakin' way. The Freeman must not kill the guardian! Its death cries would curdle the extract! There goes your paintjob! Eat it! [Blast doors begin opening] Here you go. [sobbing] Whatever it takes! The striders and hunters are working together. Radar's going off, Gordon. My dad's out there now Could you maybe...bring us back to earth? Please, Freeman. Here they come again! What? [vort calls] Ah, the Alyx Vance We dedicate ourselves to your purpose. Come on, Gordon! Hey! The cache must be inside this building. We have a strider coming in from the cranes. [Ted Backman] In Episode One, Alyx climbs up into a hidden room and uses a Combine sniper rifle to assist the player. The player never sees the rifle--only the targetting beam. For Episode 2, we decided to show the Combine sniper rifle and let the player know exactly where Alyx would be standing when she used it. However, making it visible and accessible to the player required us to come up with a way to make the rifle usable only with the vortigaunt's help. Though it's somewhat of a contrived and arbitrary device for keeping the player from using the gun, we felt it was a worthwhile trade-off, given that playtesters tended to enjoy the co-op sequence of Alyx assisting them from above. Let's see if we can get some electricity going. Excuse me, Gordon. Okay, Freeman! Be adequate! We would do well to lend our protection from above, while Freeman skirts the hazards in the pit. White Forest, are you there? Get em away from the vort! [Bill Fletcher] To create the Eli death sequence, we talked it through in great detail, wrote up an outline with all the events we'd discussed, and then produced an animatic. We used rough sketches painted over screenshots, and a variety of crude special effects and sounds to create a quick pre-visualization of how the scene would play out. Not only did this help us to converge on a shared vision for the scene, but by working rough, we were able to quickly iterate until we had a design worth implementing in the game. Oh, and Freeman! If you pull this off, I might just forgive you for that debacle at Black Mesa. You know the one I mean - involving a certain microwave casserole. I added a rack for Magnusson Devices back here. [Hunter impact] C'mon, Sheckley, move it. [pain] You handle 24, Doc! Cover me, Sheck! [Steve Bond] To compliment the Hunter's aggressive AI, the White Forest Inn was designed with a non-linear floorplan. There are multiple ways in and out of each room, as well as alternate routes to the basement and the second floor. As the player moves through the inn, the Hunters often select a shorter route and surprise the player by arriving first or by heading them off altogether. The last Hunters that enter the building, destroy two of the doors that have trapped Alyx and the Player inside. Removing these obstacles opens the entire outdoor arena for combat, allowing the player to choose whether to fight the Hunters within the building, or take them on outside. I should really help Dr. Kleiner. [vort chanting] That rocket better work...  OVERWATCH VOICE: ALL AUTONOMOUS UNITS: ACCEPT MANDATORY SECTOR ASSIMILATION. COORDINATED CONSTRICTION UNDERWAY. DEBRIDE AND CAUTERIZE. ENTERING PHASE NINE, ENHANCED COMPLIANCE. DEPLOY ADVISORY CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT. SUBMIT AND BE SUBSUMED. Attention! North perimeter breach! We have a strider, approaching from the cranes! With pleasure. Wow! Go on, Gordon. Open the gate. Let's see what we can pull up here. Good God. [Mumbling, unconscious moaning] Down here! Lie down. Well, here's the transmitter. That sounds like... [breathing] We'll meet you up in the control room when you're done. Consider yourself encouraged with all the usual aphorisms regarding practice. I'll be right over here. Let's keep going. Getting warmer. [sobbing] Has anyone seen Lamarr? Got some supplies over here if you need em. Health and ammo. That sort of thing. Yeah! Now, follow me. False alarms all day - damn crows have been nesting in the tracks. I do not know how I am supposed to concentrate with all of this racket. [vort calls] Are you sure you have everything you need? yes indeed The Freeman is in our way. Ah Christ. We'd better try to get power to the transmitter, Gordon. Eat it! All right, people, gather round. They're closing in on the silo! Hold them off! You want to check it out? Let's kill it! Gordon! Ok, Dog! Whoa! You weren't followed, were you? Now, to check in. Good. We'll keep the outposts stocked with health Now look lively in there. Warm up the delivery port. You want to follow me? Three at a time... Look - the bridge! We claim you. White Forest, do you read? Take this ladder down. Hey! The radar's picking up a supply cache. Your mother would be so proud... How many more of these are there? mmm... I can handle the truth, Doc. Should I be worried? [vort chanting] I wouldn't be surprised if the rebels used this place. That hunter targeted the Magnusson! I'm not going to continue until you leave. Observe how they fight on below, heedless of our escape. Prepare for unforeseen consequences. Oh - look at that! We can get a great view of the launch from there. we all have to do our part. Dad--- The Freeman has been missed. [Radar ping: Enemy Spotted!] You needn't attach more than one. Ah, Freeman laughed a little. I saw him. Come on, Gordon. Come on Freeman. My God. [to self]All right, all right. You're gonna be fine. Yep. Get em away from the vort! I'll be back as soon as I finish. Back over it! I've struggled with a mechanism for launching the device, but... well, your Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator clears up that little problem. [Fan sound] [pained breathing] The Freeman must not fear, only merge. Hello? Watch your heads. And... another miss. let me find the transmission More of 'em coming! Grrrreat. Such postures are but fleeting. now that the suppression field is down... You weren't kidding! [sobbing] Destroy that ship! Excellent! Just shut up and keep movin'. Make a break for the thumper, Gordon. I'll follow you! Above the Freeman. Truly, the life of Alyx Vance is in able hands. The launch would be all but impossible without his valiant efforts. forget about white forest Well, I'll see everyone back at base. Don't wait on me or nothing. Merge with the vortessence! Oh my god! Oh dear. This is a breach. A breach! That's it! The last strider has been destroyed! I'll watch the car. [Scott Dalton] We had wanted to implement a generalized particle system for quite some time, and after Episode 1 we set out to create one. In previous Half-Life games, each effect had been hand coded by a programmer working with an artist. It was effective, but not easily scalable. Our new system drew upon the aspects we found most useful from team members who had worked with both real-time systems in games and offline renders for movies such as the Lord of the Rings. The results were an artist friendly, modular, component driven system. Each system can have renderers which display the particle in some form, initializers which set up certain properties of the particle, operators which carry out actions upon the particle each frame, constraints which provide movement limitations such as collision, forces which impart complex dynamics, and emitters which determine how new particles are created. Together they are plugged into a system as needed to be as lightweight or as complex as required for the effect. Each individual component is simple, but when combined, can create rather complex dynamics. Furthermore, adding additional components to support the specific needs of a game or mod is easily done. The results can be seen in everything ranging from the simple glows of the larval extract here, to Citadel effects, blood, smoke, Hunter effects, portal effects, fire, and so forth. Dynamic effects are now in the hands of the artists, who can use them to create whatever is needed--from unique one-offs in specific levels, to generalized effects for gameplay. Check it out- If it attains full strength... Swarm! Swarm at the breach! Gordon the car's ready! Let's go! [vort attack sounds] Evacuate the area! All personnel, return to base or take shelter immediately. We must clear the area for launch! [Siren!] I'm relying on you not to squander my trust... or my Magnussons! Let's not take too long. [Aaron Seeler] One change we made to Episode 2 was to decouple the flashlight power from the suit power. Playtesters constantly had their flashlight on during the guard chase sequence and were unable to sprint to safety because the flashlight drained their suit's sprint ability. We wanted players to be able to outrun the guardian with their flashlight shining. Sometimes we are forced to make tradeoffs between conventions we've established in earlier installments, and gameplay we need now. It would be silly to not have cool looking underground passages just to keep flashlight behavior consistent until the end of time. As for the rationale within the story, players might assume this new feature was apparently the result of damage sustained in the train crash. Yeah, This is Dr. Magnusson! A barrier around the planet. Let's find the transmitter room before any more hunters find us. Go ahead and take the device out of the dispenser. The Freeman must follow. Oh crap, they must be combing the hills now. You feeling better now? It's one of those Advisor pods! Empower us! Hence, Freeman! It's all yours, Gordon. And thanks to him, the base is secure [Creaking metal] Make way! [Laughter, shouts] Freeman - where the hell are you? Don't go too far. Come on, Gordon. Let's see if the transmitter's working. Alyx! But if the Combine catch her, We have to get to White Forest. They're at 12! Bullets aren't doing anything. [John Guthrie] We wanted players to work cooperatively with the Vortigaunt just like they did with Alyx in Episode One. We didn't want to make the Vortigaunt too powerful or he might take away from the player's fun; but we also wanted him to be a good ally to have around. One solution, shown in this scene, was the shock attack where the Vortigaunt would stun a group of antlions, so that the player could finish them off. Ms. Vance doesn't look so great, Doc. You better hurry up and follow the Vort. I'm seeing a payload anomaly of approximately eight and a half pounds. Now, if I'm right about this - and I have no reason to doubt myself - you are carrying the very code Doctor Mossman had hoped to recover. [Alex Vlachos] In early versions of this map, the tunnels here were more maze-like, with branches, loopbacks and dead-ends. After watching numerous playtesters get lost, it became obvious that they were not having fun. We simplified the paths and added a number of one-way chokepoints. The curving tunnels still keep the player in suspense, but as long as he keeps moving he'll continue to progress, with very little time wasted in retracing steps. We need to send a warning to White Forest. You're breaking up, Alyx. Heh. Thanks. Take it down! Hurry, Gordon. whatever. [Strider footsteps] We did it, Izzy! As soon as I get back, we'll start on those upgrades for Dog we've been talking about. If we lose her, we lose all! We must retrace our steps and try another route to the nectarium. Hey! In here! Ewww.... Look out below! Gordon... They'll think twice about messing with us again. We did it! [vort speak] Ahhh! Never have I witnessed such a vast nectarium! Any extract taken from this nest will be of highest quality! Freeman, I repeat! There has been a breach of the secondary silo by way of the overhead launch doors. Hell no! Puzzling. The sentries should have spotted us by now. Watch your steps. All right, all right. [Ted Backman] The antlion grubs were initially created for Half-Life 2, to visually flesh out the lifecycle of the antlions. We never found the right place for them in that game, but as we developed the antlion environments of Episode 2, they were an obvious choice for resurrection. In addition to their role in the life cycle of the antlion, they provide an equally valuable service in these dark tunnels: light. As the grubs came to life, we made sure that killing them was more rewarding. In addition to the satisfying squish effects, we added the health nugget for ailing players. Soon we found many players were compelled to squash every grub in the map. It's worth pointing out that grubs also play a role in our dynamic resupply system: The more injured you are, the more health they provide, which allows us to create a consistent level of challenge for players at differing skill levels. [SHOW CONCEPT ART HERE] How the hell are we gonna outrun that thing? Hardly an adversary. Listen. That's it, we won! WHOOOO! Get him, Dog! What skill! [pain] Dad? oh Eww Headcrabs have had their way with both parties. More at 12! It's on the roof. Throw a log at those hunters! Take good care of him, ok? We must make haste. Closer, Freeman! We're on edge because this place is riddled with antlions. Magnusson and I will need to keep a close eye on the rocket's trajectory Sure is gloomy in here. [Tree explodes] The Vortessence runs strong in the Magnusson. The sawmill is that way. They're expecting you. [Jason Brashill] In the prototype for this level, the Vortigaunt cleared the way by blasting apart a rockpile. After a new model was created for the generator, we decided to exploit the vortigaunt's natural relationship with electricity by having him charge the generator much the way he charges Gordon's suit. We were then able to use generators as 'vortigates' throughout the level to indicate areas the player could enter only with a vortigaunt's assistance. This way, Gordon. Join me. Look what I found. Let's do it! Don't forget your car, Freeman! As if anyone could! [Hunter gloating] [pain sounds] [sobbing] [Mumbling, unconscious moaning] [Strider vocalization] I just wish all this didn't have to fall on you, Alyx. Come on. We're too exposed out here. Uh oh The choice is made. They are quite pleasant underfoot, are they not? [Rockslide] Oh my god. Hey gordon, you coming? [moans] Hey Doc, she's in there. Nice one, Sheckley! He's been hoping for the day when he could launch a satellite, to tap into the old array they set up at Black Mesa. That nest must be bigger than we thought. Freeman beware! Dad. Steady on. [Joshua Weier] The antlion experience in Half-Life 2 was characterized by a mindless, constant onslaught of bugs rushing your way. We devised the antlion worker for Episode 2, as a way to add depth and variety to the underground sequences, by leveraging new types of gameplay. Unlike normal antlions, the worker chooses to avoid direct confrontation, skulking in the background and lobbing acidic globs from a distance. This extends the amount of time players spend with each creature. By contrast, an encounter with an ordinary antlion is over in seconds. The spitting behavior was derived from the bullsquid of Half-Life 1, but was updated to fit the more physical world of Half-Life 2. To that end, the spit globs are not merely sprites, but physically simulated objects, flying through the air along realistic trajectories. It's all right, honey. [Acid Spit Impact] Quit it! I'm staying right here. Expect ever greater resistance as we proceed. and so we shall. Hm, we had thought the custom of knocking was universal. Sorry doc. One down! [Forklift stop] We'll take 12! [strained breathing] If I had a gravity gun, I'd be right there with you, Doc! [sobbing] Don't worry... Yeah! Mind getting the car, Gordon? Oh my god! Nice job. That'll come in handy. [Erik Wolpaw] One of the most significant story meetings we had near the beginning of Episode 2 concerned how much we were going to reveal about the G-Man. Once we had decided exactly how much to explain, we had to come up with a way of revealing it. Alyx's healing sequence offered the perfect way to pull Gordon out of mundane surroundings and put him in a realm where the G-Man can speak to him directly, but dialog is only one of our tools for narrative. By blending images from the past, the present and the immediate future, we continue to stitch together the Half-Life story over time. We make clear that the events at Black Mesa continue to resonate. And we draw the strongest connections yet between Gordon, the G-Man, Alyx and Eli Vance. All right, all right. (groan) That's it. Leave. You don't need to be here and I'm not going to continue the lesson until you leave. Use that Combine pulse ammo against em, Freeman! It's all yours. That ship must never be used. [struggle sounds.] Cool. I can't tell you how grateful I am. Below! [struggle sounds.] Oh dear God nooo... Damn it. Hunters! Her vortal form has regained integrity. Hey, vorts, thanks! We're sure glad for the extra hand! The lift awaits, Freeman! Freeman! Remember, I'm counting on you. [Power Off] [Zombie scream] Keep it up, Doc! They're getting too close to the silo! Oh, for God's sake. It's only a button. Just press it, that's all I ask. Is Gordon all right? There! White Forest, come in, this is Alyx Vance, do you read? Hey doc, you cover 36! Ah, I dunno, sounds like something the vorts would say. You had just stepped into the test chamber Hey, Gordon. If we follow them, they should take us close to White Forest. Hmm. They're coming through the breach! She may require more care than was previously the case. I just hope they're ready for what's coming. Yeah, well, about that... We're right on top of it. Woohoo, yeah! The Combine Hunters caused traumatic injury... [Doug Valente] The battle in the warehouse was created fairly late in the development of this map, when we realized that the level had a steady stream of combat but no real climax. We wanted to take advantage of Alyx's sniping abilities, building on the scene in Episode One where the player can punt boards off windows to give her a better view of attacking zombies. Here, we have the player removing tin roof panels to give Alyx a line of sight into the room below. [Base alarm] [death sounds] Nobody at White Forest has any idea the Combine are coming. We have to warn them! [Eric Strand] Developing the Half-Life episodes allows us to steadily flesh out the details of an ongoing cosmic struggle. Most of this conflict remains far in the background, but little by little we are able to bring new elements up front. One of our goals for Episode 2 was to fully develop the grub-like Advisors, first glimpsed in Half-Life 2. In Episode 1, they make several brief appearances but have no direct effect on events in the game. In Episode 2, we deliberated about how soon to show them becoming active, and decided to pull back the veil in stages. Therefore we first see them being hauled around by combine troops, completely passive. Next, we see one waking up from incubation, still somewhat groggy and beginning to discover its power. But at the end of the episode, the Advisors come fully into their own, front and center, as characters with a huge impact on the story. According to the radar, there's a beacon inside this building. Eat it! [Gabe Newell] Welcome to Half-Life 2, Episode 2. We are at the mid-point in our trilogy of episodes which will conclude in Episode 3. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your use key. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press the use key again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your use key again to stop the commentary. Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play this, our latest installment in the ongoing adventures of Gordon Freeman. I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com. I get about 10,000 emails each time we release a game, and while I can't respond to all of them, I do read all of them. Thanks, and have fun! dad...hmm Oh god no. The honor is ours. Miss! [Siren!] [vort pain] Open the gate up, Gordon! No offense Freeman, but things were pretty quiet until you showed up. Ah... May the veil be switfly lift or, if not lifted, rent. Thanks, Gordon! Ha ha... For God's sake, Freeman, what is taking you so long? Oh, I cannot concentrate with all of this racket! [Guardian shell crack] From Judith? I should have never let her go! An advisor... It's so good to have you back, sweetheart. 36 again! Maybe we should have left that thing alone. I hope so, anyway. Take it down! [vort speak] Hey, those power lines are coming from this building. [Metal creaking] One sec, I gotta reload. [pain sounds] We work well together! Hold on a sec - I'll get you out of there. What happened to you? Oh god I'm next. which is starting to seem ever more likely. Hurry up or I'll do it myself! We're catching up, boy! That must be an ancient entry. There are no backup sites. If we fail, the best we can hope is that the rocket falls on the enemy. Now...inertial navigation systems... Oh! I got ten! Well, Gordon. Freeman... Goddamn it, TAKE IT DOWN! It's one of those things we saw in the message from Judith. Gordon, come on. Get inside! Careful! There they go again. Miss. We should bring the car, Gordon. We did it! There are Advisors yet unhatched. Ah. Get em off me. It's not gonna leave us alone. Oh boy, here we go! [pain] That rocket better work... Yes. Everything working all right? [Ido Magal] Whenever possible we try to give the player a glimpse of their eventual goal, even before they realize it is their goal. While we try to design such moments intentionally, sometimes the opportunities present themselves. In this case, while setting up the gag where the rail car slides into the abyss, we opened a hole in the wall and discovered a view of the distant thumper. It became clear that we could tailor the view across the giant cave to foreshadow the spot where Gordon would eventually end up. Of course. Whatever the cost. In a minute or two. You know what to do! [Stalactite impact] from you Head humpers. Hmm. 12's going crazy! Any help you can give him, get in there and do it. Looks like we need your help again. [Alfred Reynolds] Training players who haven't played previous episodes is always a challenge. Those who had not played Episode 1 did not immediately understand that the Combine sniper beam was friendly. They avoided it, thinking it could damage them. Therefore we added this staircase scenario, where we re-introduce Alyx's sniper behavior and make a show out of her shooting a zombie to protect the player. Hey! Major swarm! We don't know for certain. They've got no idea the Combine's heading their way. Freeman, you have anything to take down a chopper? better step on the gas. There goes the radar. believe it or not gordon, it's been in place since you sent up the final satellite from black Mesa. You hear that autogun going off out there? [empty] [vort attack sounds] and I need her. No! There we go. Yes! [moans] The larvae yield the vortal pellet. The guardian's presence guarantees the nearness of larval clusters. They are commonly posted near the young. Now listen here, Magnusson. [Vitaly Genkin] This puzzle proved surprisingly difficult for many players. In an earlier version, not only did you need to find the spare gear, but this elevator was connected to a disabled generator that wouldn't operate until you also attached a crank and jump-started it with the gravity gun. Although it sounds simple, most playtesters got stuck here for many minutes. We kept simplifying until we hit the version you see here. Shoot the Mag Device! You have got to destroy it. Now take it down! I'm never gonna make it. Mm-hm, we should head out. Uh...guess it's been a while since you drove a car, huh? Don't be deceived. Disable that turret, then I can work on shutting down the forcefield. Look alive! Incoming at 36! [cheering] Must be one of those tracking beacons in the van. [moans] [Blast pulse] Go ahead. What now? I think you found it, Gordon. The wire starts here. Let's get driving, Gordon. Pre-flight alignment complete. White Forest sentries are doing their job. This looks familiar. Oh, not again. What the hell is going on in the secondary silo? Now you'll want to use your gravity gun to throw it. Hey, we got the rifle charged up! Tested and operational. Why are you walkin, man? You got that car! [sobbing] Cover 12! I can't let it happen again. I'm never gonna make it. I think they're pissed about the citadel. Seriously, Freeman, you need to get going. Node and nexus, feed upon this life! Dad! [Ken Birdwell] This Strider has big parts of him rip off, he spews goo everywhere - he's a great test bed for new modeling technology and our new particle system. We custom built him just for this sequence. With our Episodic process, a lot of new technology comes online throughout development. Since any new technology takes a year or more to really work out all the bugs, we like to look for insolated areas - like this one - where we can test out new things without risking all the things we already know work. We did this with HDR and our lostcoast demo; once we're sure we didn't break anything, we can move the features back into general use. Since this strider worked out really well here, he'll be the new Strider as we move forward, and we'll be applying what we've learned to any new monsters in Episode 3. Ware! No freakin' way. We'll keep the hailing frequency open on the chopper radio, in case Judith tries to reach us again. [Metal breaking] Well... that's within tolerance, certainly not worth scuttling the ... The lift, Freeman! It is almost here! You've done enough already. The rocket! We're dead! Gordon - you've made a breakthrough! Hell no. To our honor we follow you. Hahah. Yes, yes, we can all be proud of the effort--- Combine's been trying to head in the front door. You better heal up doc. Hey Griggs, you might want to show Dr. Freeman where we keep all the supplies, huh? Headcrabs! Stay sharp. We're not done yet. [Yahn] We tried several different ways of showing the Advisor traveling with the Combine forces. We started off with an Advisor pod flying over the troops, much as they flew from the Citadel at the end of Episode One. However, we didn't want to give the impression that those pods were anything but emergency escape units; they were not meant to be self-powered flying crafts that could be piloted around in future episodes. We ended up with the solution you see here-APC's are pulling a structure holding an inert Advisor pod. This lets the players study the Advisors at different points in their lifecycle. They see the main stages of the Advisors' metamorphosis from harmless larvae into powerful and highly mobile monsters. once we reach altitude, the existing satellite array will begin to reactivate. We need to restore power to the transmitter. The Freeman must use caution. [Creaking metal] We did it! Oh my god, HUNTERS! Couldn't have been easy out there. Better luck next time, slowpoke! [Hunter: Enemy Found] Yeah! Please... In among us! Now! A Hunter! All right, now it's personal! Striderrr! Still beats going on foot. Ah, but now that we've found it, we can use it against the Combine! [Merle Dandridge] The other thing that's so great about acting for videogames-and I guess voiceover in general, but for this particular game is so amazing-I don't have to worry about hitting my mark, or playing to the camera or forgetting my lines. That's usually my biggest thing, you can see the wheels turning on camera because I'm trying to keep up with my lines. But this, they're all right there so I don't even have to worry about that and I can just worry about the delivery, the emotional vibe that needs to come across, and just be the sense of immediacy-I don't even have to worry about the words. So that takes a whole other level off to let the actor get down and into the work, which is really, really great. Which is why I love this job. The Magnusson has instructed me to admit you into the secondary silo. [pained breathing] Oh my god! We knit shattered bone and restored circulatory integrity. Now, Freeman. Accompany! They're waiting for you in the sawmill-that way! [vort attack sounds] [pain] Jeez, that place was full of antiques! Is that it then? Thanks for your help, Freeman! Ah, spectacular! The Freeman's weapons, though inferior, seem sufficient for the task. Nice shot, Doc! There's the power source for the shield. [Vortigaunt healing sounds] Follow, Freeman. Dad... Back over it! Sheck! Stay back and give the Vorts room to work! [Creaking metal] Bother us not! I though you were in real trouble for a minute there. Abide a moment longer, Freeman, that we may proceed together! [sounds of struggle] We stray, Freeman! Hey doc, you cover 24! Return to sender. For the Freeman! Stay sharp. We're not done yet. Ah crap You handle 12, Doc! Gordon and I are more than able to handle this.  What is up with this road? We're history! Nice! Plus, it'll send a homing signal to your HEV suit, in case you get separated from your car.  Protect the vort! Oh my God! We're going to want to get back up to the tracks and keep our original heading, but in the meantime, maybe we can find those vortigaunts. We did it! We held them off! Good work everyone! We are on the right path to the nectarium. The Vorts are tearin' 'em up! Ahh crap! Let's get the hell out of here. Beware their caustic spray! All right, doc! what's that? [Strider splatters] Yeah! [pain] very nice What? [Joshua Weier] As much as possible, we try to create small surprises for the player that aren't related to combat at all. With this forklift puzzle, we wanted to trick the player into assuming that once they operated the lift, the puzzle would be solved. However, the player soon realizes that the obvious solution is actually a bit of misdirection. Here's where we turn it all around, eh, Freeman? Oh, and Freeman! If you pull this off, I might just forgive you for that debacle at Black Mesa. You know the one I mean... involving a certain microwave casserole. Hey doc, you cover the breach! Dire sublimity! Hmm... we're getting a signal but I don't see anything. Well, there she is...gassed up and ready to go... some small repayment owed for your own survival. This should only take a moment. Wait a minute. These Combine bastards just don't give up... I think they're pissed about the citadel. [pained breathing] [Antlion grub excited] We got the breach! Looks like the elevator's stuck up there. One light! yes, the array has lain dormant since you so ably annihilated the nihilanth. [Elevator gate up] Over here, Gordon. [vort pain] No it wasn't. You handle 36, Doc! [struggle sounds.] Ah, Freeman, you seein' this? Maybe we can find some supplies. Hey Griggs, did you see that? [vort speak] Push the button, Gordon. Gordon, come here. but there's still so much. That's a good sign. [Jason Deakins] A glimpse of the antlion guardian in this level sets up anticipation for the more extended confrontation in upcoming areas. The player needs to know what he's getting into, so that the vortigaunt's warnings will all make sense. We sure as hell did! That message from our mutual friend. This isn't rocket science. Well, my contribution is. All you need to do is shoot the device. I believe Gordon should have the honor. That can't be it... Let's take em out! it's too much. I can't wait to see Dad! I think you mean cavalry. Strider! The combine found them all right. Agh! We must part ways, Freeman! Lead the antlions away! Catch up with us when you're done. It's one of those beacons that show on the radar. Well, safe haven it ain't. [breath] His cord is cut. it would appear you've plundered the citadel storehouse like a Get back! No problem. Ah! Oh... Mmmm Mmmm... A human is needed... How much time have we got? None of this will Right, Gordon? Nice driving, Freeman! [Hunter death sound] I feel it - she fades. Noooo! Forward, Freeman. Hold on... Heads up! Hahaha. As you can see, the Magnussons are fragile. They will disintegrate immediately if they miss their target. [Strider splatters] I realize this moment may not be the most convenient for a heart-to-heart, This is Dr. Magnusson. And I am pleased to announce the secondary silo has been sealed. Well! Back to work! Now, now... Thank you for your patience. Go, Dog! This vortality fails. [Metal groan] The humans have their enclave on the rim of this canyon. Aim for the carapace. [Hunter shield on] Where are you two? You're gonna miss it! Shouldn't we have that looked at? Crap--roadblock. Yes! Yes! Go get em, boy! I think that... Die! The door is up here. [Power On] Are you okay? We call em Magnussons cause it doesn't take much to set em off. Yeah, we heard you ran into a little trouble out there. [Vortigaunt fires] That nest must be bigger than we thought. Home sweet-aw, shit! Hey - easy on the clutch. [vort calls] It must have gone for its space suit... I'm going to rest here. We got the breach! Truly, Freeman, well done. The controls have got to be around here someplace. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to ditch me. Shoot it now, Gordon! Yet it was the Freeman who retrieved your vortessence. [Laughter, shouts] and they've been on our heels ever since. Your aide is most appreciated. I don't think we're through yet. Whoo take that. Unforeseen consequences... We will charge you. Let's go, come on! [laugh] No, not us. The Combine! You have to get ready! Uh oh... [David Speyrer] The approach to the White Forest Inn contains a number of elements that set the scene for the coming ambush. The road is blocked by Combine walls; a soldier spots you in the distance and radios you in; and two hunters run across an opening on the far side of a fence. All these clues are there for the attentive player to spot directly, or to create a sense of growing apprehension in the player who might be paying slightly less attention to the details. and this one hatched So you have summoned the lift. [pain] [Hunter scanning] [pain sounds]Gordon! Miss! [Advisor Chatter] We must hasten. Dr. Freeman, you take care of the turrets. [pain sounds] Gladly we accompany. They made these things to last, didn't they? I'm not sure how they'll use the satellite to shut down that portal but... [cheering] We got dropships! Now listen here, Magnusson, there's no call for hurtful comments. Join us, Freeman! That's it... That's it for me. Gordon... [Grating open] Launch the rocket, Gordon! [vort speak] Lift-off. God damn it, let go of him! Would you mind plugging it in? I'm here now. Is the Freeman unfamiliar with the custom of knocking? [Jennifer Seeley] Sawblades were a prominent weapon in Half-Life 2 and we wanted the player to recognize them as part of their arsenal in the upcoming warehouse battle. After watching several playtesters ignore them completely, we decided to add this zombie pinned to the wall. Most players pull out the sawblade and instantly realize its potential for destruction. After that, they tend to find and use sawblades without further prompting. Is anyone still alive in there? Hurry, Freeman, take the lift aloft! Truly it is the Freeman. mean a thing if... I think it's hurt! A single one of those damn things could shoot down our rocket. I better let my Dad know you're all right. There's something else here. Oh, fine - no one grants me a moment's peace, but by all means - unroll the red carpet. Would you please just shut up. We'll take 36! One down. Above. Freeman! Keep trying, we might get lucky. Here goes! Seven... The breach again! Yeah. We'd better get back on the road. There's an Advisor around here someplace. [breath] Step on it, Gordon! Oh, I hope Lamarr is watching No interruptions! Ho, yeah! I give the Combine a lot of credit, though. They're tough competitors, a real class act. You are fortunate indeed to have the Magnusson's guidance in this matter. [Gary McTaggart] At various times this gear was loose in the environment, tucked in a dark crevice, hidden in a small box, or lost at the bottom of a flooded pool. One playtester, unaware of his low health, actually drowned in two feet of water while retrieving the gear. We realized that attaching the gear to a chassis identical to the engine motor was the best way to help the player make the connection between this gear and the empty space on the other assembly. The Freeman must stand still. It is... The Void lays claim to its own. Be right there, Alyx. You, too, Dr. Magnusson. [Cave ambience] Got some ammo for you doc. [Advisor pod opening] Between us we may finally have a chance to--- you go ahead gordon. I don't want to leave him alone just yet. Blip. Wow! Wait'll I tell the gang I actually helped bail out Gordon Freeman! (chastenend) I'll be quiet now. the payload capsule itself will not enter a permanent orbit until sometime afterward Head up. Doc, help the vort! You heard him, Dog. The recent refugees have had no experience in repelling common predators. Gordon... I think the zombies want their stuff back! Ah, Freeman, you seein' this? Howdy Doc. Has anyone seen Lamarr? [pain] We have to get our bearings, but we can definitely... The whole place is lightin' up, grab a tunnel! [struggle sounds.] Well, unless there's something else... Ugh! the whole launch is a bust. Spray em [Merle Dandridge] So I really don't think I had any idea what I was getting into when I auditioned for the game, because I really had no clue what Half-Life was, what Steam was, or what Valve was about. But I did have the feeling that it was something that was really heavy since when I was in the waiting room. Everybody that was sitting across from me just seemed like they were stars or recognizable faces. And then the first time that I sat down with the Valve team, they showed me some rough animations of Alyx and immediately I just couldn't keep my eyes off her. She actually looked like someone I could be related to, and that has never happened to me. Whoa. [vort chanting] [Gate closed] Stand clear. 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer---Sorry. [pain] What's going on? It got quiet all of a sudden. What harm has come? We'll keep this place stocked with health We'll wait for you here, Gordon. More at 24! See ya! That was quick. I was so afraid I wouldn't see you again. [Greg Winkler] Once we added the onboard radar to the strider battle at the end of the episode, we needed to train the player in its use well before they reached that area. This garage was already in the game as a place where Alyx needed to stay while the player went alone through the autocannon area. It was a perfect fit to have the mechanic rebels add the radar to the car while Gordon was busy somewhere else. Nice, That did the trick. Sorry. [Firing flechettes] There was a time they cared nothing for Miss Vance... [sobbing] Tracking beacon...there's another bit of cruft we can ignore. Support equipment powered down. Judith made some terrible choices. Proceed, Freeman. Ok, let's go. Dr. Freeman, Alyx Vance is over here. Let's go in. [Joe Han] Players under pressure can overlook basic tasks, so we try to make the important ones foolproof. On this map, players often forget to check their health level, but rarely forget to seek out Magnusson devices. We narrowed doorways and set health supply racks right by the entries, so that players rushing in to get explosives would find themselves automatically picking up vital supplies. But... Alert! There's a strider getting close to the base! Magnusson would be proud! [Joe Demers] Earlier in the level, we blocked the path with fire and forced the player to turn off a gas jet to continue. Fire traps of this sort were plentiful in Half-Life 2, but we could not count on players knowing or remembering how to use them here. Having offered some brief training, we now build on the mechanic by having the player work with Alyx to create a cooperative fire trap. Most players turn on the gas, at which point Alyx shoots a zombie on the stairs to create the wall of fire. This triggers a parade of zombies to come out of the door below and walk into the fire. Right in the melon! Come on back and we'll get going. [vort pain] Let's get back outside. The Freeman must not fear. Uh...isn't this the way back to the bridge? To me, Freeman! One passes but we live on. Freeman! [struggle sounds.] [sounds of struggle] Dad! No. Die. Whoooo! That thing looked like a fish out of water. There it is again... Incredible! Heh heh! earthsuit... I love you, Dad! Picking it up again. Dad, please. Dad! Ah. Freeman. It is well. Damn these things are tough. Take care of each other. I couldn't be prouder if you were my own son. Sniper! No need to thank me. powering...down... I don't think we're through yet. They're still after the data packet! A sound. Try that power box, Gordon. [struggle sounds.] Not again. Sheckley! This place is a deathtrap-let's get out of here! Yeah. No. Sure. They're only like five feet tall. For Freedom! [pain sounds] [pain] [vort pain] I've been there once or twice, so it shouldn't be too hard to find. on your way here... Let's hope that holds long enough to power up the transmitter. well, it's unimaginable. The device has an inbuilt homing function...if you get it in close range of the strider, it will close the gap and affix itself to the carapace. Car's ready. Perimeters clear. Still no sign of incursion. Jeez, that place was full of antiques! Gordon! It's good idea to take advantage of cover for now, in case they're doing fly-overs. You have done the hardest work, admitting entrance to this chamber. You must not distract me from sustaining the Alyx Vance. Something's upstairs! Come on, Gordon. Well now what? Eli, Eli? Are you there? Two lights. It's like the First Days all over again. Looks like the combine found this place. [Phil Co] Before we create any final art, we use placeholders to see if the gameplay is working and to figure out the proper dimensions and shapes for the model. In this level, we used an old pumpkin model as the placeholder for the Magnusson Device. After we decided that the gameplay was fun and the pumpkin worked well, a proper model was created using the pumpkin as a template. [vort attack sounds] Our guns aren't cutting it. That is all for now. Heya! Here goes... Indeed. [vort chanting] We didn't manage to kill it, and now they know exactly where we are. All it would take is one strider to destroy our rocket. Yeah, yeah. Well, we're close enough to make it the rest of the way on foot if we have to. Oh, what next in the parade of constant interruptions? Shit! We must move her there quickly. Did you do that? Well, we should keep moving Can you use the grav-gun here, Gordon? [Mumbling] [pain] [pained breathing] Don't be alarmed, Freeman. This strider's days of impaling your friends are a thing of the past. I'll get right to work on the analysis Dropships incoming! Here we go. [Vortigaunt healing sounds] AHHH! Watch your turret Doc! Freeman'll do the hard work! Turrets! Turrets! What a relief. So, they've sent me Freeman, have they? Good man. Kill it, Freeman! I have identified the overhead launch door assembly as the source of the breach. Wow! Each step brings us nearer to the nectarium. We must not tarry. I should have aborted that damned test. Shoot it! [vort speak] Alyx! Dr. Freeman! You made it. No need to thank me. Dog! There you are! Drop what you're doing and get to the base! Defend the silo! [Dog vocalization] Will we be able to launch before they attack? Wiser words were never spoken, save possibly by the Magnusson. Miraculous secretion! T minus ten... Hey, I was living there! They told me it's keyed to rebel caches...stuff we might need. [moans] Did you hear something? They're sure in a hurry. It dissolves the false veils that divide the vortessence. All right, the road's clear! I hope that was the last wave. That's right. [First gear] I'll just step out until you've finished if that's more convenient. It's moving offscreen. Ground and high-altitude winds... The striders and hunters are working together. Heh. I'll take this. I might need some help on this one. I'll wait here. I think that's White Forest! Let me give it a shot. Hey! They're traveling in packs! [Distant Antlion Grub Chittering] It's just another false alarm in the secondary silo. [gasps] Oh my God! [vort pain] Don't worry, Dad - we're fine. Hey! Stop that! One time, back in the city, I saw a guy take down a hunter with his bare fists! Attention! Attention! The striders have been defeated! All personnel return to base immediately. Repeat. All personnel return to base immediately. Oh my God. Make haste, Freeman. More at 36! It's a joke. Fantastic, Freeman! You okay in there? Duck! We'll keep on the lookout. the fruition of your many years of service and devotion are about to reach their culmination The vort said we should kill them before they hatch. Are you coming or what? You'll find us in the auxiliary control room. I'm hurt. We must hasten. Uriah, send the target to the far end of the rails. Picking up some kind of anomalous troop movements... [Gautam Babbar] Starting Episode 2 in the crashed train has several purposes. From a story point of view, it establishes continuity with the end of Episode 1. But from a gameplay perspective, it allows players to reacquaint themselves with the basic movement controls in a safe, contained environment. Our earliest design had the player scrambling out of the wreck high above the canyon, and forced them to make some precarious jumps to get to ground level. After seeing most playtesters fall to their deaths numerous times in the first five minutes of gameplay, we optimized for perceived rather than actual danger. Excuse me. Halt, Freeman! And attend! Thanks for helping out, Gordon. Accept energy. Pass on! We've got to see this right away! Here... They're at 12 again! The density of antlions is most promising. It all but ensures that we will find larval extract in the lower reaches. Rarrgh! We shall quiet them. Whatever troubles we might have had were the result of staffing and supply deficiencies. [vort pain] Take shelter near the repellant device! Freeman? Freeman, I hope you can hear me. This is Dr. Magnusson. Ow! [vort attack sounds] Of course. Get the chopper, Gordon! We'll take the breach! These traces of former habitation somehow sadden me. [moans] I might need some help on this one. [Metal creaking] Bugs! Come on, Gordon, get the car and we'll challenge Dog to a race. We'll take 12! I don't like leaving the car...it could be spotted from the air. I don't know what you did, Guidance computer voltages and currents... Get off! Well, this place is hell, but at least it's not North America. Going my way? Find a way back to the power box, ok? They gather and unite the scattered Combine forces. Hey, Gordon! Let me show you how the antlion sensors work. Bye, Dad. We call em Magnussons cause it doesn't take much to set em off. [struggling] Come, then. I will get you on the path to White Forest. [out of breath] They're out there. Well, if they got it over there, maybe we can jump it back to this side. Finished. Those buildings look like they've seen some use recently. Shit! Rollover! Uh...what...what was that? just have to... Four... [vort calls] I think White Forest is just over that ridge. For everything. [River sounds] Get it!. [Merle Dandridge] So a lot of times we'll try a line in several different ways, like set a different mood for a different scene, or maybe just do a different take on a line. Like one might be, it sounds trite but, you know, one excited, one not so excited, or one a little more pensive and thoughtful. Suggestions are always thrown out there for new reads and it's the coolest kind of teamwork. It's not just-'Here's your script. Go!' It's, 'Let's work this out, let's find the best middle ground,' and everything is always pliable. If it's not working, maybe we'll go back and do an instant rewrite or something, and for me that's creative heaven. Absolutely. Watch where you walk. Here it is. [pain sounds] Follow me and we'll let you get in some practice while we still have time. He'll be glad for a chance to get out of the silo. [Gautam Babbar] Having established the superportal as a threat in the opening vista, we decided it would make a useful landmark as the player traveled toward White Forest. In Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, we could count on the Citadel being visible in many of the maps, casting its shadow over the whole world. The superportal plays the same role in Episode 2, anchoring the player in the world while providing them with visual updates on the developing threat. The addition of beam effects and portalstorm shockwaves help bring the portal to life and make it more than merely a static background element. Maybe it's just flaky. If you don't mind? [struggle sounds.] [Power On] [vort calls] They were feeding huge volumes of data directly into the core destruction sequence. We are under attack! Mine now, mine. Its energy empowers us. The Combine have been repelled! I'll watch the car. It's not gonna leave us alone. Let's see if we can find some way to ditch it. Good grief, I only meant they might... The VORT needs help! Hate bugs. Looks like the calvary's here! I wasn't even supposed to be here. They're trying to open another gateway. I cannot fend off antlions and keep the Alyx Vance alive. No. [Shattering glass] [moans] These Combine bastards just don't give up... Now take it down! There, there, sweetheart. We're together now. Strider at the silo! Strider at the base! I can handle the truth, Doc. Should I be worried? We shall share the vortessence. Same old Doctor Magnusson I see. Over to you, Gordon. [vort speak] Hey, Gordon? Want to plug it in? [laugh] Gordon... Dad? Are you okay? [Advisor Chatter] Well... Check. it's hatching! Freeman, clear out those mines! [Strider splatters] The Alyx Vance requires a tether to the human realm. What? Help! Fly, you beautiful bird! but, that is such a remote possibility Five... [pain] [Launch doors start closing] It's not safe here. Let's get in. Don't worry, sweetheart, we're going to make it. Beware, Freeman, acid! Let's check those sheds at the top of the hill. We can't get out till I open that gate. The scent of extract grows weaker! [pain] They sure hate these Magnusson devices! [Creaking lift] She could well make another attempt. Tools? We've got a whole shop over here. Come on, we'll get you set up. It's hurting, Gordon! why, even a fragment of a raw transmission will give us penetrating insight into [Bryn Moslow] This room is designed so that the player will notice the main set of plugs right away, but is less likely to spot the second set at first. One end of the long cable is already plugged in, encouraging the player to grab the loose end and put it into the powered socket. This makes the faulty wire break loose and spark. With the power on, players try to return upstairs only to discover that now the elevator needs power. At this point, they look about more carefully and discover the elevator sockets. The short cord is tucked next to the elevator sockets, so that they are likely to use it there first before realizing they need a longer one. Given this fairly reliable progression of events, we were able to write a limited number of lines for Alyx, so that she could react each time the puzzle changed state. White Forest. Uh oh. Shall we resume? Yeah! If we are to press forward, the Guardian must die. The power's out. There has to be a way to jump it across! Here come the hacks! Ah-the ancient guardian! Retrieving the extract may not be unchallenging. Waver not, Freeman. I've taken a few liberties with your car. I'm going to go see Dad. All right, we got all of em! Yeah! I sense the Alyx Vance's thread unraveling. [Steve Bond] Many of us are fans of Lost, and we noticed several strong Half-Life references in the first season of Lost. Gabe Newell and Lost creator J.J. Abrams exchanged fanmail, and Gabe promised Abrams there would be a Lost reference in Episode 2. We delivered on the promise in this obscure area of the White Forest Base. [Danika Wright] Racing Dog to the base was not a preconceived plan. It was born out of testing the level over and over, and repeatedly trying to keep up with Dog as he ran to the base. This was sufficiently fun for us, that we began to figure out ways to encourage players to do it too. I don't want my father to think we were caught in there when it went up. When he brought in that crystal I knew I... [Third gear] I'm glad to be back. When I plucked her from Black Mesa, I acted in the face of objections that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone. [Advisor scream] I'll bet the Combine aren't too happy right now. And who is going to watch him? All this you shall witness when--- [vortigese] Silo doors open. Like that? [Gate opens] Combine hands. No problem. This is regrettable. [Groans as he collapses] Shh. Quiet! We're not alone White Forest, do you read? Head on in there, Freeman! There is no way we can launch before those striders are - [Gear Lever Engages] It's locked I can't be bothered right now. [Dog Alert] Hop in, Gordon! What next in the parade of constant obstacles? [vort chanting] Let's try the transmitter before any more show up. [Matt Wright] Rather than just make up something that fit our fantasies of a rocket, we designed Dr. Magnusson's rocket around blueprints from the Titan Family of missiles. Grounding the details of our world in reality, making them as precise as possible, makes the invented, fantastic elements seem that much more believable. [Hunter: defend strider] The clock is ticking. [vort attack sounds] [pained breathing] Let's move! These mines are killing us. Whoa! Hey! [pained breathing] [pain] No! [David Sawyer] In earlier versions of the Hunter intro, the Hunters burst physically into the room by shouldering their way through the door. As the Hunter's flechette attack came online, we decided this was no longer appropriate. Now that the Hunter had an effective ranged attack, having him burst into the room with you actually put him into his least viable tactical position during your very first encounter, making him seem ineffective and a bit dumb. The current design is intended to showcase his abilities, while giving the player the time and space to understand the situation before pushing out into close combat. [David Speyrer] Many players had a hard time orienting themselves in the valley. Before the fight, we send players to the sawmill without telling them how to get there. This was a way of familiarizing them with the map without any time pressure. Still, the size and nonlinearity of the map was confusing for first-time players once the battle began. The loudspeaker announcements that direct players to incoming striders initially referred to compass directions, which most players couldn't follow because they couldn't remember which way was north. We added White Forest Peak as a global landmark and distinctive local landmarks, like the cranes and the water tower, and referred to those landmarks in the announcements instead of compass directions. This helped, but some players still had a hard time knowing which way to go at any given moment. Our ultimate solution was the car's radar, which along with the landmarks, helps players go where the action is. We have taken a wrong turning. The nectarium lies elsewhere.  Yes! Thank you, Freeman. We didn't manage to kill it, and now they know exactly where we are. Doc, you ever see an antlion before? Something tells me we haven't seen the last of them. I'll catch up to you later. [vort chanting] superb work in delaying the citadel core reaction, you two! It must have been quite exciting. Stations everyone. I think the vorts want you down there. That's it. Wake me up when you get back. Travel well! Too many! Power to main thrusters. Same old Doctor Magnusson. That's it for me. with sub dimensional properties. There's been a breach Listen to Dr. Kleiner, Dad.  Over here, Gordon. We have no medkit, but this should suffice. Freeman - Freeman, you're not doing anything. Make yourself useful and find out what the hell is going on in there. [Kelly Bailey] The Antlion tunnels, carved out by worker antlions using their acid secretions, make up the third of three subterranean spaces with a distinctive visual style (man-made mines and natural cave formations being the other two). The presence of crawlspaces was dictated by game design, but they evolved into chambers that fit logically with the life cycle of the antlions. Here, the young grubs can develop and feed in safety, although--conveniently for the player--they cannot digest useful items such as health kits. We make an admirable team with the Freeman. [Derisive laughter] How are we gonna get through here? Everything's going to be all right. White Forest is so close, I hate to waste any more time. [vort chanting] magnusson's done a remarkable job here. Keep trying, we might get lucky. [Gate crashes shut] Oh God, they're coming from everywhere! Hey doc, you cover 36! Remember, keep em distracted while Freeman takes em down! It's the Combine. Nice shot, Doc! Hold on a moment, Kleiner. God. Damn. It. Uh oh. [Hunter angry] Now! I didn't. That's working! Maybe while I'm getting the car fixed up, you can see about clearing up that roadblock? I love you! Good luck, Gordon. Just let me start the decoding process, I don't hear any more hunters. Very well, Freeman. Try it now. Hang on! The base is around here somewhere. [Striderbuster explodes] Let's look for a transmitter room. Don't ever say ''of course.'' We can't take anything for granted! What's that? Something on the radar. Too right! You did it! It's shutting down! The car's ready, Freeman. Alyx is waiting inside. They're not as tough as they look! What's the difference? We made it. Safe at last. We're about to watch the transmission from Judith. [Skidding sounds] Bravely done, Freeman! When you reach the lower chamber, you must find a way to summon me! We'll be back on the road in no time. If we're going to beat the Combine to White Forest, you'd better hurry. We got 12! Doctor Magnusson has an old rocket up at White Forest. [Dan LeFree] Originally, the Episode 2 chopper battle was a classic fight that relied on use of the RPG. In the meantime we were experimenting with a completely new way of fighting the chopper which we hoped to have ready for Episode 3. The early Ep3 experiments were so successful that we pulled them straight into Episode 2. They're coming from 24 again! Hey, don't worry about us. See this car? We're fixing it up and getting the hell outta here. Driving to Hawaii! Beaches, babes and waves. (in low tone) Tell you what, if you ever get sick of this rebel crap, you know who to talk to. Where are you? [Impact sounds] And in case striders aren't bad enough, recon indicates they're being escorted by packs of Hunters. Uh oh... You bear some traits we thought innate to vortikind. No wonder it's mad. Found the gate controls! The Alyx Vance will be safest where the vibrations are strongest. Reporting normal. They put everything they had into sending it To our knowledge, he is still at White Forest, working on the portal shield. Some things never change. Dog, help us open this gate! [pain] You think there could be one around here somewhere? Noooo! You're all right! All right, people - change of plans. Ah, the Freeman! [Impact] Join now as we imbibe the extract. The Freeman. This will necessitate deep submersion in the vortessence. And thanks to your warning, we'll be ready when they get here. See if you can shut off the force field. Combine coming! We cannot fire without harm to the Freeman. I can hardly believe it. [cheering] Boy, are we glad to see you guys. I am confident the Freeman will find a way to open that gate, so that we may proceed together. [Vortigaunts chanting] Ah Christ. WHAT? Below the Freeman! The Borealis? It's real? Unworthy foe! [moans] Yeah. That vibratory device may offer us some respite from our present foes.  I guess we can expect more of those... Hold on! Now, once you're down there, I'll have Uriah let you into the secondary silo. Yes... Cover 36! [Carl Uhlman] In early tests, playtesters didn't realize that antlion grubs drop health nuggets, since they tended to pick up the nuggets by accident after squishing the grubs. In order to showcase the feature, we placed a grub on the far side of this webbing. When a player breaks the web, they squish the grub and send the nugget rolling. Most players chase the nugget and naturally understand how to exploit grubs in the future. The base is vulnerable until you find the controls and shut the overhead door assembly. A bit more challenging at this range, isn't it. [struggle sounds.] The Magnusson did well to choose you for that task! [pain] We gotta get moving. [pain] [vortigese] Doc, can that grav gun help us? Thanks. Doctor Freeman. Those hunters don't do well against a well-aimed radiator! Hey, I was watching that! That portal's gonna open all the way and then... If we can find a way past this... Mmm.. Wake up, Dog. Listen carefully, my dear. splendid! Magnificent! Thanks for clearing out the yard, Freeman! Heck of a job! Oof! Let's see if we can get out a message to my Dad. Incoming!!! If you please. Freeman, how many grubs did you step on? They cannot explode like those you will find in the field. Boy am I glad to be here. What? Keep up the good work, Doc! [Metal creaking] [Impact sounds] Ah, I think the vorts want you down there. [Birdsong] Come on Doc. There it goes... Somewhere in that sequence, they would have had to establish a connection with the far side Get away!   Oh my god! God, these hunters are tough! Hey Doc, she's in there. So you can see The secondary silo can be reached through here. If I delay a single moment, I'll never hear the end of it. Wooo! Those things that attacked us at the mines... Hey, do you know if it is possible to get a message to the White Forest base from here? I'm never gonna make it. they'll tear out everything she knows. Get ready, Gordon. There are so many ways to die out here. Turret down. Would you mind... Come on, knock that thing out of there. [Hunter minigun firing] Let's go Griggs. Doctor Kleiner told me that Judith headed north in a helicopter right after they got here but he wouldn't tell me why. The Magnusson is much respected. [vort pain] This mounted gun may prove useful. [vort healing] Right that turret! On your knees, Strider! The barrier's working? We should find a way out there. Freeman, if you're still out there, return to base immediately! [vort pain] No! I know of humans with a vehicle, not far from here. No, this is Alyx Vance. Nice to have em in a pinch, Thank you, baby. I'll catch up with you in a bit. Hold. [pained breathing] Good God! Medkit coming your way. [Cave ambience] [sounds of struggle] [Gautam Babbar] Sometimes, even in an action game, it can be hard to convince players to act like an action movie hero. Here, we wanted the player to make a 150 foot turbo jump off the edge of the road and crash into the boxes at the bottom. Instead, wary playtesters routinely took the safe way down. To encourage more recklessly heroic behaviour, we disguised the easy path and added obvious ramps to clearly communicate this was a legitimate feature of the level. Nice work, Gordon. Don't give up, Freeman! You're doing great! [Hunter: melee ready] [Acid Antlion Bursts] You'll just have to wait until after the launch. Oh God, they're coming from everywhere! Beautiful Oh Gordon, thank God you're all right. Gordon... [sniff] Few believed the Borealis would ever be seen again. Refugees! I wish someone would have warned them about headcrabs. Hey, this ain't so bad. We could be inside getting browbeat. Rockets over here! Careful! We're down to our last two turrets, Now attack! You think this is bad, you should spend a day working in Magnusson's nursery. [Joe Han] From the beginning of Episode 2's design, we intended for Alyx to be gravely injured and fall into a coma. However, the timing and nature of her injury changed dramatically. In the earliest version, the player woke to find Alyx already unconscious. We wanted the player to be unsure of what to do, but instead this turned out to be merely confusing. In the next iteration, Alyx balanced precariously in the train car near the player, only to slip and fall as the train shifted. This was unsatisfying because we have painted Alyx as tough and agile; having her injured in a fall seemed arbitrary and impersonal. We kept trying to add a stronger emotional aspect to her injury--something that would give rise to anger and fear. Around this time, the Hunters were coming online, and we were having trouble giving them a really powerful introductory moment. Solving both problems at the same time, we introduced the Hunters as the cause of Alyx's injury. [cheering] Oh, the corona! Doc, you're really puttin on a clinic. Pardon me. [moans] The Freeman is a worthy companion. Hey! Where are you--- No time now, Doc. You ever miss Black Mesa?  I do.  And I was never even there. We have to find her. Oh. [Eric Strand] Originally, this room came directly after a long stretch of combat with antlions, and opened up into more of the same. Players who opened the door were faced with another swarm, which they were expected to clear with a whole bunch of handy grenades. However, most playtesters were fairly tired of antlion combat at this point, so we decided that a complete break from antlions would be an even better alternative to blowing up more of them with grenades. Follow, Freeman, while I track it to the source. In the control room... Or you can get 'em... Oh man. Here we go again. And look at you, son! I'm not asking for anything that goes against your nature. Hurry, Freeman. [pained breathing] Yeah! It's gonna be close. Have a medkit! Let's go to the control room. Here - you take the gravity gun. Look at him go! I am pleased to see at least you are unharmed! Down there! One of the turrets got knocked over. Okay It looks like I can open them from here but I won't be able to come in with you. Let me summon my kin! [out of breath] [Blast pulse] [pained breathing] Defend the base, people! Don't let 'em near the base! [vort speak] [vort calls] Seriously, Freeman, you need to get going. Our place is here. [Storm of crashing and crunching sounds] [Flechette near miss] I'm hurt. Finish it, Freeman! Amazing we survived, isn't it? [Laughter, shouts] [Distant Rumbles] I don't think that one's getting up again. Another alarm? That's it. Let's hope there's no more Combine between here and White Forest. And I look forward to hearing the staff's excuses for why they couldn't handle it themselves. [pained breathing] Okay! Power's on up here! Why are you walkin, man? You got that car! We got 12! We need to stop em here! Magnificent! We can't hold out much longer. Save yourself! Well... The least he could do is say hello. I hope that suit of yours is warm because [Flechette explosion] Prepare for unforeseen consequences... [struggling] [Vortigaunt chanting] [John Morello] In sketching out the scenes for the episode, we noticed a lack of interpersonal conflict between the characters who had survived from Half-Life 2. Alyx, Eli and Dr. Kleiner have a lot of affection for one another, as you will see in many of the scenes. And while we all value the benefit of strong positive relationships, we were happy to have Dr. Magnusson around to get irritated by all the hugging. Freeman, are we done? Dad... [Gate open] The sawmill is that way. They're expecting you. I think I'm okay. Hold on! [Katie Engel] Originally created as a minor background character, the vortigaunt lab assistant, known internally as Labby, was so popular with playtesters that he evolved into a fully developed character with a unique name and a special place by Dr. Magnusson's side. Swarm! Oh, sorry. We shoulda warned you about that turret. The lift has arrived! Go quickly! You handle your weapon well, Freeman. One light! I wouldn't dream of letting you go without a proper goodbye! Alyx! Keep up the good work! Only a few striders left! I'm never gonna make it. Zombies! Gordon, here comes a medkit! Looks like an old resistance outpost. By the Vortessence! Dad. Well what else could we do with him? He isn't actually operating the radio, I told him to just make sure no one touches the knobs. For Alyx, Oh, never mind him. You'll find the sawmill at the far end of the valley! It's a trap! Freeman, go help the vort! Whoa! [struggle sounds.] We weave the Freeman's life with hers. I think-uh, yessir, Dr. Magnusson. Here you go. Oh no. Not right now. We'll be okay as long as they stick to one tunnel. Gordon, quickly... [Dropmine captured - ping!] Good luck out there! Lead on, Freeman! Yeah, we all got ten, there's hundreds of 'em. [sobbing] [pained breathing] More antlions. I see. Oh, crap. More? I'll keep a lookout while you poke around inside. We'll need to step up the launch schedule. That's a nice suit. [Impact] Magnusson said whatever you say, goes. [Dog hits strider] We're catching up! [sobbing] Gordon, wait! [Randy Lundeen] One of the three main themes for antlion areas, the mines were a plausible setting for light sources, mechanical obstacles, and resupply. Visually, the mines offer good contrast to the natural cave areas and the more organic spaces the worker antlions have carved out with acid secretions. [Big splash] Now I'm ready We'll see you in the auxiliary control room. We surge. How many more are going to have to die? No! There you go. I will stabilize her, if the Freeman will provide us with protection. What? What was that? [sobbing] Ehhh!!! We'll keep this place stocked with health I'm still a little weak, but I'll catch up! Listen to me! I don't freakin' believe it. Well that means she's still alive up there. What, no hug? Here. Wait for me! They will understand our urgent need. Strider! I wonder if he got any of that. I sense the extract grows near. We must hurry! [sounds of struggle] Hey, Doc, you might want to grab a gun, down by the vort! [vort chanting] Let go of him! If you wanna start chipping away at that chopper, I'll poke around and see if i can find any medkits. Yes... [vortigese] Oh yeah. No...no! Let him go! It's just good to finally be here. Now... That's it, we won! WHOOOO! I'm right behind ya. Freeman! Keep your eye on the lights! Come on in, Gordon. Here they come! It's Alyx and Gordon Freeman! Oh... Hey! Watch the paintjob! I believe we're ready to start the autosequence. [pain sounds] If not, your sacrifice shall not be forgotten. Hi. [vort attack sounds] Hit it! [cheering] I guess you cleared up that little problem. Keep an eye out. It looks like hunters are traveling with the striders. They're working in packs! I'll cover you from up here. so they had an advisor pod hidden in here Our job is to keep them from reaching the base to the south. Oh man, that was cool! [sobbing] Go ahead now. It's time for the real thing. Hide! Data? From the Citadel? Reloading! Get ready, oh God, get ready, three lights, this is going to be bad.... Well done, Freeman! You handle 12, Doc! Ah, you found it. Behold! Take out the Hunters! 
We'll never make it at this rate! Well, that was random... If there's anyone left in the city, we'll try and help them out. This might not be as easy I thought. Let's just give up now... We can't get through here till that soldier's out of the way. Shit! We should... Oh, I hope to God they can't remember what they were. Over here! I don't believe it. We need to get across here. We've gotta find a way to power up this bridge. Dr. Kleiner said it would all heat up again soon. I'm so glad to see you! We can grab another train once you're clear. Hear that? Huh, looks like your kind of weapon. Look around, Gordon. Maybe we can find some kind of tool... but why? We gotta get outta here! There, Gordon. Dog's happy to see you... I can tell. Izzy? Dad? Are you there? It looks like we're gonna have this train all to ourselves. Hey, thanks! I blame Black Mesa... Get on here! Here, let's open up this next track. I'm sorry Gordon. I just can't face them. Alyx? Hey - nice shooting! Get back, Doc. I'm sure you want to help everyone else get to safety first. Damn, there's a guard on the platform. I was hoping they'd have cleared out by now. The Combine's on our tail. I'll try to grab everything I can while you're in there. Hah, that did it! There you are. Hah - I've got it. They can't get out of there now. It's weird, they're wide open. It's like they're just dumping everything. I'll catch what I can and--- Oh my god - stalkers. Crap, it's dark! Ah good. I uh... One at a time, boys. What a drop... See what I just did there? From the rooftops! Oh, hey Freeman. And this is the Missus, I presume? Run for it! [Exhaling] Hmm... Come on, people, head for the train stations! Get out of the city while you can! Did I just see that? Let them fight it out, Gordon! Let's get out of here! [to Gordon] Well, you do have the Hazard Suit. Yikes! Thank God it's over. All aboard. If there's anyone who hasn't evacuated yet, we've got to get them moving. Breen!? At least when the Citadel goes up, it'll take them with it. Yeah. Someone's gotta get rid of that APC. Where'd you go? Oh, you're kidding me. A Strider? In here? Yeah! Gordon help me - please! Go on without us. We've got stuff to do. [Chet Faliszek] In early versions of the episode, Alyx was much more vocal about giving the player hints. However, playtests showed it was much more satisfying for players when Alyx stated a goal and then stepped aside until that goal was accomplished. Because of that feedback, almost all of Alyx's hint lines were cut. Eventually, though, we discovered through more playtesting that although players didn't like having Alyx hand them unsolicited hints, they did want to be able to explicitly request help from her. We added some of the hint dialog back in, but it's only accessible at the player's request by plus-using Alyx. Unfortunately, we learned these hint lessons late in the development cycle and didn't have time to properly train players for this feature. We plan to integrate the hint-on-demand dialog more thoroughly in future episodes. Oh, there goes the light! Hey, Gordon, before you go. We did it, Gordon. Try another rollermine, Gordon. There it goes! Watch out for the sniper. Dog's happy to see you... Dog, once we're across I want you to get out of here. You won't be able to follow so I want you to go find Dad. That way, I'll know where to find you. Okay? We have to get across. This is the only way to the core. Dog, are you all right? I'm out - reloading. More are coming! Yep! Haven't you heard you're supposed to evacuate? Even so, there is greater reason for hope now than at any time in the past decade. Whew! Well that was close! Watch out! Unlike the Combine soldiers who volunteer for what they get... They'll have it on the other side soon. Come on, people! It's your last chance! Huh, that was a close one! Whoa... Pick it up with your gravity gun. Is this it? What do you hear? Start her up again, Gordon. Do what you did last time. [Jason Mitchell] Alyx travels through much of Episode One with the player and consequently passes through a wider variety of lighting conditions than she did in Half-Life 2. This meant that we had to improve the quality of the lighting algorithms used on Alyx to look realistic in any situation, from the eerie hallways of the Citadel to the streets of City 17 at sunset. For this episode, we added a specular lighting term to the shaders used on Alyx, which provides a realistic shiny look to her skin, her leather jacket and even her teeth. In these new lighting calculations, we chose to specifically emphasize bright highlights caused by illumination from grazing angles. This type of lighting, also referred to as 'rim lighting' is particularly dramatic when coming from low-angle light sources such as this bright sunset. You'll also note that the rim lighting is further enhanced by our high-dynamic range postprocessing, which causes the specular highlights to bloom in a striking and dramatic fashion. We have found that the move to an episodic development cycle allows us to take advantage of the fast pace of graphics hardware innovation by incrementally adding new features, such as Alyx's new lighting techniques, to the Source engine with each new episode. Thanks a lot! This is it. I can't go into the reactor room, so it's up to you to dampen the reaction. It's too late to reverse it even if we wanted to, but at least we can buy some time. Take down the strider. But listen, you two have got to get out of the city. Let's get to the train. [Shock sounds] All right, Dog, Ow! Are you okay? Okay, I see what's going on. I think I can just, hm... Look at the Citadel. Oh please, let this be the way out. Yap, yap, yap, why don't you let Freeman get a word in for once? Let's go! Go! Now! It's coming for us! I hate these things! Thanks a lot. Block off the hole the antlions are using. It's that stalker. What are you doing? We can analyze it later. Hop on the lift over there, Gordon, and I'll lower you into the core. I'm coming back. We've got you covered! [Shock sounds] What was that? Therefore, I repeat, evacuate City 17 at once if not sooner! I cannot state this without enough undue emphasis! We have to get this thing moving. A dropship! Let's get the power back on and get the hell outta here. What's that? So much for better living through science. [Pain sounds] We don't have time to look for another way around. Careful. Come on! Get off the street! The Combine's moving into this area! [Tom Leonard] Our AI is inherently unscripted, which means that we have to design spaces that permit our characters to make good choices. The AI is better able to make intelligent decisions when there are alternate routes through a combat space. This hallway started out as a straight-shot corridor with a door at the end for soldiers to enter through, but this design didn't provide the AI with enough choices to make the soldier behavior very interesting. Adding an additional space on the side allowed them to find cover and flank the player, both of which dramatically improved the entertainment value of this encounter. Look out! hmm Haven't you heard? The Citadel's gonna blow! Get out of City 17! Uh oh. What now? Makes sense if it was powered by the Citadel. Yeah, better safe than sorry. Sounds good. Let's go. Hold on a second. Get it away from me! There's one over there! Let's go! Hey, it's doing something to the gravity gun. [John Guthrie] This three level parking garage is where the antlion burrow training pays off. Because we've taught the player the burrow blocking mechanic earlier in a less hectic environment, the problem here becomes not what to do with the burrows, but where to find the cars to block them while fighting off a horde of antlions. The burrows themselves went through several iterations. At first, playtesters had a hard time seeing them, and once they'd pushed a car onto one, they often weren't sure if the hole was actually sealed. We eventually solved both of these problems by adding a particle effect to the burrows. This effect makes them recognizable even at a distance, and its absence is a clear indication that a burrow is blocked. Damn battery! Do you see light somewhere up there, Gordon? [Randy Lundeen] The hospital was a completely new interior space that we had to design pretty much from scratch. Like most of City 17's visuals, it was inspired by Eastern European architecture. The surgery lamps and the overall white and yellow color scheme were drawn from photos of a hospital in Chernobyl. The tile work and the high archways were chosen to give the area the institutional feel of an old European hospital, and the beds were based on some old World War 2 images. In fact, we avoided modern-looking fixtures and furniture altogether in order to differentiate the place from a contemporary hospital. [Shock sounds] All right, Gordon! I have to start again. Whew! That was close! Okay! The portal destination is untenable. Surely you can set the relay elsewhere. There's no way I can survive in that environment. We'll never make it at this rate! We'll meet you there. But it's important enough that they've been hounding us the whole way here. It's friggin' dark... Hold on! Are you okay? Thank you, thank you... These readings are off the chart. We're all gonna die! What?! Thanks, Gordon. Looks like this could be a transport elevator to the core. Good shot! The core reactor should be down there somewhere. We've got to hurry. Try lobbing a rollermine up there. Somehow I thought things would be better by now. Blam! Okay, dampener in effect. I can lock out all the stalkers now. [Pain sounds] Found it! Whoa - this place is really coming apart... The elevator's down in the core entry. Let me see if I can call it back to this level. Okay, what did I miss? There it is. We've gotta get across here-but how? Let's just give up now... Let's join up with those people. Hear that? Here they come! Huh, what a drop. Yes! The trainstation! [Laughing] These are so much fun, man! Ah, that's better. Uh...could you excuse me for a minute? Come on we have to get out of here. Oh no, the Kleiner speech is starting again. CAN'T SOMEONE MAKE IT STOP! If only there was some way to get across the gap... Where are we supposed to go again? I doubt we'd want to follow them to the end of the line, but it'll be good to put some distance between us and... These antlions must be coming from the subways. Who was that? Take down the gunship. I know you! It's losing power. Damn. Would've been handy to keep it charged up for awhile. I guess it was feeding on the runaway core. Here we go. Hey, Freeman. Get back out there and help. Come on, Gordon. Let's go find the power switch. Previously, certain protein chains important to the process of embryonic development were selectively prevented from forming. This is no longer the case. For those so inclined, now would be an excellent time for procreation. Which is to say, in layman's terms, you should give serious consideration to doing your part for the revival of the species. We must make the most of the time we have, as it is by no means certain how much time we have secured ourselves before the Combine attempt to restore their dominion, as they certainly shall. Grenade! They're on! Let's get in. I see you did all right without me. Let's get it going. Dark as hell... Grenade! Okay. Oh boy... Finally, fresh air... Get after that soldier with the rocket launcher! I think we've made a terrible mistake... Gross! Run! The citadel's really coming apart. Would have been handy to keep it charged up for a while. Ah! I can see it! [Shock sounds] [Jake Nicholson] Barney's big crowbar scene required a few tricks to pull off. There are actually three separate crowbar models in the sequence. First, there's one stuck in the machine. When Barney grabs that one, we remove it from the world and switch on a crowbar that's been in Barney's hand the entire time, only invisible. Both of these models are purely decorative, so as soon as Barney makes his tossing motion, we hide his crowbar again and create a third, useable crowbar that then bounces to the ground. They're coming! Hold on! Don't waste those rollermines. Okay, boy. Pack up and meet us on the far side of this ridge. All right, let's try another one, Gordon. Light! We'll have no time to shut it down. crushed Keep your light on that zombie! Shit! You got off easy. Whoa! Jump! More of em! Oh! Direct intervention? It's hopeless! Looks like there might be a way out of here on the next floor down. Oh, Alyx, my dear, I do hope you are far, far away from the Citadel. You did it! The handle's broken off. I wonder if it's still around someplace. Good. Let's see if this does the trick. Okay, run this group of citizens over to the train. These are our people! Hey! Hurry up, this train is leaving! Help! Come on, Dog. With any luck we should be well out of the city before it's too late. I can't get this down. Keep your heads down! [Keith Huggins] It's important that the player has some empathy for Alyx, rather than just seeing her as a bullet-spitting robot. The brief recovery scene after the pod mind attack reminds the player that Alyx is affected by events in the world. What? Oh dear! But there's really no time! The core is exceedingly close to collapse. Why, there's no way to get far enough without first...well...nothing short of a direct intervention in the core could possibly retard the reaction. Thank God-it's still day! Let's get out of here. It's just so dark... Can you find where those rollermines are going? The last trains are leaving...get everyone aboard and we'll hold off the Combine. Can you move that stuff Gordon? We've gotta get through here. It's a gunship. Good - they're getting away. Alyx! Thank God... Dad? I met Odessa Cubbage one time. What an idiot. Go over there, Dog. We'll meet you up ahead. You're Kleiner's daughter, right? Let's go. Careful! Get on! Any luck over there, Dog? This way! Careful, Gordon, they're swarming down there! *laughter* Hold on. Uh...right, can we keep moving please? Alyx? Okay...that's the first stage stabilized. Good. They're bringing in more stalkers. I can't do much to help you till you shut the next stage down. Here we go... You'd better get started, Gordon. I'll be fine here. you're a real terror. Another gunship! [Fighting sounds] Let's move out together. Let's charge up the powerbox and get out of here. [out of breath...] Well, good luck. Sure thing! We can't leave till that strider's taken care of... it's the only way I know to the reactor core. Okay, cover me while I catch up. Kill it! Up there! All aboard! There has to be a way to get across. Hey - an elevator! Hey - there you are. [Sounds of struggle.] You okay? I've heard stories about you and airducts. If we don't take that strider down, no one's getting out of here. Hey, Dog! Watch it up there! Knock it off! Ungh! I was so worried.... Sweetheart, come in! Turn on your suit light. Wow. I've never been so glad to see Dr. Kleiner. The next group is ready for you! You need to go take care of the core, I'll try and figure this out. How are we going to get through here? Keep us covered, Freeman! Keep your light on it. We'll catch up, don't worry. What is he up to? I'll get this. Man down! Eat it! Get it off me! Get it off! Look out! Hop on. If the Citadel trains are still running, there's a chance they might take us right out of the City. Uh oh...what was that? Did I mention I am sorry about the lights? Looks like they had the same idea we had. The manner in which these exceedingly rare quantum effects percolate up into the physical plane will be fascinating to witness-however, not at first hand. The ravages to cellular material are unimaginable. So much for better living through science. Those last trains are leaving-we've gotta keep moving. Ah, you found one. Come on, I can't do this alone. Cross your fingers. [Steve Bond] Antlion guard arenas have a few specific design requirements. For instance, since the guard is only armed with a melee attack, we can't let the player reach any place that's inaccessible to the guard, such as rooftops and other high perches that the player could only arrive at after being launched by a guard headbutt. The arenas also need plenty of physics objects for the guard to toss, and at least one unlimited ammo crate so that the player can't run out of ammunition before killing the guard. For this battle, we also introduced a steady stream of regular antlions to limit the player's ability to constantly circle the antlion guard. [Shock sounds] A gunship! Well this is one hell of a wrinkle. It's getting close... This was the only path I could find. Here... Get the hell out of here! [Scott Dalton] The ball tubes are an example of us working within our available toolkit to create a puzzle around a recognized concept. As a physical navigation puzzle, it's different from what the player has experienced before, and it's challenging while not being a binary succeed or fail situation. There are a number of ways to approach this puzzle. In addition to simply dodging, jumping and ducking the balls, the player can grab or deflect them with his gravity gun, or pick up the hatch and use it as a shield to block the incoming barrage. You know what to do, Gordon. Let me see if I can pin down a path to the core. [Charlie Burgin] The first prototype of Episode One's door-blast effect was here in the Combine garrison. Being peppered with chunks of wood while soldiers poured into the room through a haze of smoke proved to be an effective dramatic tool. It was also an excellent way to simultaneously ungate the player and flood the area with enemies. It was so unanimously successful in playtests that we ended up adding it in several places throughout the episode. Eat it! Ah, anyway...shine your light on the door over here and I'll get us out of here. Whatever you call it, I hope I don't ever see another one. Damn. We can't call the elevator cause the power is out. Traitor. They're always saying something's about to blow. I ain't buying it this time. [Fighting sounds] Heeellllpp!!! What's taking so long? You're supposed to protect us! Let's do it. We made it, thanks to you! I think I got what I needed. We've got a lot to do here, and I can't do it without you. [Ken Birdwell] Rappelling soldiers presented a difficult training problem, because we've found that it's tough to focus the player's attention upward. This entire alley was carefully designed to ensure that the player would see the descending soldiers. First, we framed the soldiers with a straight line of buildings. Then we had them run across the rooftops so that they were starkly silhouetted against the sky before they dropped down in front of lightly colored buildings. Finally, we added a distinctive sound to the rappelling action so that players would recognize it later in the game. After you. Dr. K's in fine fettle, isn't he? Hurry up! [across the distance] See you at the station! There's some kind of slot for a crank or a handle here. [Fighting sounds] Whoa! Nice trick, Dr. Freeman! Ugh.... It's got a grenade! Where are we supposed to go again? [John Guthrie] Here we're presenting the player with a now-familiar ballsocket challenge, but we're also bridging into some new training, showing the player that Stalkers can destroy the Combine energy balls. Oh, wow! Okay... Let me think a minute...um.... [Gautam Babbar] Whenever possible, we like to foreshadow impending boss battles by introducing the enemy before the actual fight. In this case, you know you're going to be seeing that gunship again pretty soon. Okay. Okay... I hate to do this, but... Nice punt! Quiet...listen... We need to get through that door.... Get the gravity gun, Gordon. Breen!? We didn't make it yet. C'mon! Where are you? Maybe we can pick up some more passengers once we're outside the city. I'm surrounded! Hey, great! Good idea, Gordon! Help! The Combine's not making it easy. We're trying to get enough people together to force our way through to the trainstation. People are meeting up in a safehouse nearby. Oh dear, Eli, I'm sorry, but...surely there's no need for undue alarm? We'll come with you. Are you? Shine your light on that barnacle! I repeat, you must evacuate the city at once. Okay, they're safe, go for another group. My hero! Well... It's going, Gordon. You did it! We're in your care, Dr. Freeman! Cover the burrows! Oh, hey Freeman. And this must be the little lady. We need to get it to my Dad and Dr. Kleiner at the outpost right away. I think I see an access bridge up ahead. Stop One more for me. We've stalled out--see if you can get us going again. Yeah! Looks like we'll be fighting over seats on that train. [Greg Coomer] This intro sequence establishes some important initial pieces of Episode One's story and setting. Our earlier versions of the intro sequence were heavy on graphic effects and relatively light on storytelling. When we showed those early versions to playtesters, they thought it was cool, but rarely had any idea what was supposed to be happening. We went through several iterations, each time simplifying the editing and tightening the effects. We eventually arrived at a good middle ground between the sort of psychedelic look we were shooting for and basic comprehension of what was actually taking place. I don't have many more of these so...try not to lose this one, okay? [Sigh] That was close. Something's... I can't hear you! I think we go this way. We can get through now. That's it - keep pulling. [Ido Magal] Here we wanted to include something a little different - an escort mission. Most of our gameplay involves constant forward motion, so we wanted to design a situation where players would fight through the same basic area multiple times. This temporary backtracking would create a series of encounters where players had a full tactical awareness of their surroundings. Once again, all of this turned out to be more easily said than done, and this sequence went through a lot of iterations. Originally, the train yard was one big space. This approach had a couple of problems. Since players had a constant, unbroken view of the entire area, it was virtually impossible to maneuver enemies into position for staged combat events. And because they could always see the goal, players didn't get much of a sense that they were leading citizens somewhere the citizens couldn't get to on their own. Ultimately, we broke the environment into two different spaces, a parking lot and a maintenance building. Because neither area can be seen from the other, we're able to repopulate the spaces with new, more deadly combinations of enemies while the player isn't looking. It also makes the journey feel lengthier and more significant. [Scott Dalton] Impending destruction is a recurring theme in the Citadel. From story, mood, and visual standpoints, this changes the Citadel. The destruction needed to feel natural rather than entirely scripted on the player's actions. Not showing the destructive events dynamically makes the player assume the level of damage is static. However, if the events are too obviously triggered by player movement, the destruction feels too scripted. We found the solution was to give the player glimpses of things happening at the periphery of the player space, as well as in their immediate vicinity, to give the feeling that this stuff is happening whether the player is present or not. Hold on! I'm doing okay, just going crazy trying to --- That should give us all a little more time to get out of the city. And I've got a big chunk of information for my Dad and Dr. Kleiner to work with. Please let there be a way to the surface. Promise me that you won't take a single unnecessary risk. Give me a second. They're all aboard now. This is what happens to you if you resist. Those last trains are leaving-we've gotta keep moving. Ugh. Whew! That was close! Oh God...not again... Thanks! Hey, Dr. Freeman, I heard you were there when Odessa Cubbage took down the first gunship? That must have been a real honor for you. I'm proud to say I met someone who knew Odessa Cubbage. Get back! Dog! The Stalkers. [Fighting sounds] [out of breath...] Well, we'll have to find another way around. Where are your friends now, huh? I really don't think we should hang around. I got a bit swamped. This is the switch. Let me get this going. [Laura Dubuk] The train the player rides out of City 17 had two major design goals. It had to visually connect the end of Episode One to the beginning of Episode Two, and it also needed to address some functional gameplay requirements of the second episode. Using reference material we'd collected on European train cars from the 1980's, we built a basic version of the train that level designers could test. Once we got the thumbs-up from them, we added textures and lots of little details. The result is basically a caboose combined with rounder, more streamlined elements from a passenger car. How are we ever going to get across? Why? Oh...good... Let's get out of here! [Fighting sounds] I hope you two are here to help. They're me... There goes the light... [Fighting sounds] Izzy! Right there. We've got to keep moving. Thanks. He's holding it from the other side. There we go! That was close... Whoa. Here we go. Sometimes I think everybody's a doctor but me. these people didn't have a choice. Nice shooting! Don't let that thing get ahold of your head! [Pain sounds] Good. Another locked door? Find the powerbox and I'll get it open. It's up to you now. [John Guthrie] After the antlion guard fight, playtesters were reporting some combat fatigue. We decided to include an environmental puzzle here to break up the pacing before the subsequent street battle. We originally worried that a densely packed room full of hopper mines, tripmines, and explosive barrels was a little too implausible. But playtesters loved the sudden reveal of the room and then enjoyed navigating it, so this ended up being another case where we accepted a trade-off between fun and maintaining a strictly consistent fiction. Go get the next batch, Gordon. We should have brought everyone over at once. Oh, here, let's see what I can get out of this. I apologize for any inadvertent errors or omissions. As you can imagine, we have had scarcely time to record, let alone rehearse- Almost done... Whoa! Nice! Great! Okay, another group of citizens coming through. Keep an eye on them. Keep away from those things! Let's keep moving. This is hopeless. There's no access. No way to... [Fighting sounds] Hell yeah, we're with you! Shit! It sees us! I'll just disable this field, and.... Careful! They're counting on us! Look out...barnacles! Okay, looks like I can let that ladder down to you. Let me shoot out the latch. Holy Crap - Help! [Dhabih Eng] The core design posed a lot of difficult challenges. Generally speaking, if the gameplay in a particular map isn't working, we can simply cut the entire area. That wasn't true of the core, because we knew it was critical to the story. On top of that, designing Citadel gameplay is often a bigger challenge than working out areas in City 17, largely because Citadel levels have a narrower set of gameplay tools; There are less enemy types available and the player is usually only armed with the gravity gun. Because of this, we had to go through many iterations of the core design. One of the early prototypes was a kind of futuristic version of 'Operation' where players had to use the gravity gun to cleanly manipulate rods into slots in the core. That didn't work partly because playtesters found that their view was obstructed by the rods, which made it frustratingly difficult to manipulate them with any kind of precision. We prototyped, playtested, and abandoned several other designs until we finally arrived at one that was fun while still being challenging enough to give players the sense that they'd accomplished a significant goal. But Dad... Wow! Sorry I haven't been more helpful getting the power back on. Put down whatever you're doing and help me over here. [Gautam Babbar] This City 17 vista is an explicit visual reward for surviving the elevator battle. Since early playtesters told us that we weren't communicating just how damaged the city was, this sweeping view of an extremely messed up City 17 serves a practical purpose as well as being a nice moment of calm between storms. The framing of your first view of the Citadel in this vista space is very deliberate. We included various leading elements, such as wires and light poles, that all drive the player's eye to the Citadel. Run! Ah! One more-over there! That one! Hurry! Huh, I wonder why only the Elite guard are holding their posts? Oh no... Stalkers! I can't---we can't stay in this car. [Huge sigh of relief] I can't reach it over there. Pull it off, Gordon. Rollermines... [Shock sounds] We'll need to take a close look at it, of course, but I should be able to give a better opinion within a few hours. Go for the strider! Looks like there used to be a crank that fit in here. I wonder if it's still around here somewhere. Got it! What about... What a move! They're coming from above! I don't believe it. [Fighting sounds] Nice move! Ah crap! Here we go. The citadel is really lit up. We don't have much time! I can't go out in that. What now? You're doing great! ...if it were discovered by the Combine. We're not done with that powerbox, Gordon. A dropship! All right, Dog, Ah...light. Charge your flashlight now...I'm gonna need some time to get this powered up. It's alive! She's waiting for you. I'm still shaking... They're coming from above! What's that sound? This is it... That's how it's done. Oh god! Here we go again. One more for me. I can't get a clear sight on that gunner...can you open up a line of fire for me? You, citizens! Follow Dr. Freeman! Go ahead - take the gravity gun. Ah! That was close! Looks like you've got things under control. Come on, Gordon, crank that thing! I uh... Okay. We'd better keep moving. [Fighting sounds] I don't think there was anywhere safe. Come on! Oh man...APCs! [Robin Walker] This ledge is a really tricky spot for NPCs to navigate. While we wanted Alyx to be able to maneuver dynamically through any complex environment, in certain navigation situations we're faced with a trade off between flexibility and visual quality. In this particular case, she navigates this ledge with a combination of AI and scripted animations. We continue to evolve the systems of Half-Life 2 whereby characters move fluidly through dynamic AI and scripted navigation, but ultimately what matters most is how it looks to the player. [Ido Magal] This explosion permanently seals the cafe door, which has a few benefits. From a design perspective, we've found that when we limit the amount of backtracking players can do, it gives them confidence to venture forward. From a practical standpoint, we can clean up the now unreachable entities, giving us a big reduction in overhead. It also helps to minimize potential bugs and exploits. What the hell is that? Gotta reload. Somehow I thought things would be better by now. If I can get this box working again, there's no reason I can't get the lights on in this whole sector. Then the doors will just work. Hell yeah, we're with you! Looks like we'll have to backtrack. Dad taught me how to reset the targeting system on these things. More rollermines! Come on, Gordon, let's put them to work. More of 'em! Whoa! Nice! *pain* Now don't worry about me. I'll see you soon. Yeah! Ha! Ha! Get on here! This place is coming apart at the seams. We stayed behind to get you moving. Come on! [Matt Scott] This area was redesigned several times in order to keep the player in this space while Alyx delivers some exposition. As much as we hated to do it, the final solution was to have Alyx climb out while the player looks for an alternate route. We portray Alyx as more athletic and nimble than Gordon, so the player shouldn't get too irritated by the fact that she can get to places they can't. Honestly, we're not especially happy with this crutch, but it's a trade-off we sometimes have to make so that we can get Alyx out of the way of interesting player challenges. Is all I know. Hear that? Sounds like the elevator's moving again. Oh, crap! The last thing I remember is... It's a lot more unstable, but it should last long enough to take out Whoa! Nice trick, Dr. Freeman! Hey Gordon. Miss me? We've gotta deal with that gunship before anyone else tries to get through. No - please - stop screaming The packet's done copying. They're everywhere! Look out! Careful. Make for the trains! Uh huh. Better find Barney and get moving. There's more of 'em! Aim for the head! Grab one of those flares! Oh my God...Strider! Let's move out! Alyx, come in! Let's go. Whoa! Sound good? Damn, you need to recharge, don't you? It's a raid! There's no telling how much time we have left; it can't be that much farther to the trainstation. Yeah, yeah, good to see you. Now, where's Dog? He must be worried sick about us. Let's find another way up. Oh God... [Scott Dalton] The second ball tube presents a variation of the pattern the player learned in the first ball tube. While the first tube can be crossed slowly by crouching and maneuvering your way up, the second ratchets up the pace, requiring a quicker, more responsive approach. [Pain sounds] Go ahead Gordon - jump on. An antlion guard! Whatever's in that transmission packet, These things suck! Alyx, no! There you are! And those who resisted have met a most terrible fate. Brace yourself! I love you. Oh, joy. [Bill Van Buren] We wanted to create an atmosphere of urgency in the Citadel, with Alyx and the player focused on getting to the core to stop the impending collapse. Initially, we tried to reflect that urgency through Alyx's behavior and acting. This proved to be unsustainable, however; if the player didn't choose to advance, Alyx eventually ran out of lines or animations and was forced into her very non-urgent idle states. We found that the best approach was for Alyx to have such implicit trust in, and sympathy with, the player that she is always content to proceed at whatever pace the player chooses. Once we adopted this principle, lines where Alyx sounded impatient or frustrated with the pace of progress quickly stood out and were cut. Good job sealing the burrows. I think we've made a terrible mistake... Dr. Kleiner says we can mate now. Not that I needed his permission. Look up! Heh, that'll teach him. Put the car back. Maybe it'll slow them down. Dog, I think I found something. Lost another one! Take care of the citizens, Gordon! Right! One dead strider coming up! Look, Dog, I told you to stop clowning around. Here they come! Look at them all... I can't do this when those antlions keep coming after us! Isn't there any way to stop them? Wait'll he hears the great news. We don't have time to deal with this. Say again? Never mind - let's move! Yeah. Here they come! Help! Shine your light on that thing! Damn. Now go, boy! Go on! You'll be fine, just... That was really something, Doc! Oh, no...try again, Gordon. You're going to have to go in and stabilize the core yourself, Gordon. The stalkers might try and prevent you, but you can't let them. We don't have much time. I'll get a head start on the next train. I'll get this. Turn around! Hey! I wanted those! I don't know how the hell we got out of there. I'll be right there! I might be a little bit rusty with this rifle... Okay! See ya when I see ya! Okay, we're in luck, the door just needs power. You've got the flashlight; see if you can find the powerbox. Light em up! It's this way, Gordon. Well, we won't be going back that way. We can't get through here while that sniper's covering the street. Let's see if we can take him out from over here. Cover it up! A dropship! Can't see a damn thing! Keep your light on the powerbox. I'll get a charge going through it. Looks like the bridge is out of power. Come on, Gordon-get in! Yeah, we must be on the right track. [Sigh] What are you into, Dog? There's no question that it will, I'm afraid. Take the gravity gun, Gordon. Gordon, don't leave me. Ah! Those overhead turrets should make short work of them. Oh no! We're all starving and Kleiner's headcrab is probably eating Grade A head. Never thought I'd be happy to see those trains again. This way! I don't miss Dr. Breen, but I do miss his show. Remember when he had the jugglers on? Oh my God...the transmission's going out. You stay with the passengers. We'll get this train moving. There's more of 'em! I've got an idea how to use one here. I don't miss Dr. Breen, but I do miss his show. Remember when he had the jugglers on? Hold it out where I can work on it. It won't last forever, but at least we've bought a little time. Why haven't they left already? Okay, Gordon, the train's ready to go! You didn't forget the crank, did you? Found it! We're vulnerable out here, Gordon--let's get this thing going. Keep away from those things! Head for the trains, people! I'm putting you in the care of my old friend Gordon Freeman! Jesus, Gordon, That's how you do it, eh Freeman? There we go. Good. Hold it steady. Grab one of those rollermines and bring it over to me. For what the Combine fear the most is not any tangible human weapon, but our will, our intellect, our ability to respond selectively and rationally to every terror they turn against us. This is unbelievable... Hey, did you hear something? We've gotta take care of that guy with the rocket launcher first. [out of breath...] Soldiers! It was touch and go for a minute there. We got it. There it is. Gordon - hold up a second. Good shot! Wait till he hears that we found you. The Citadel! Hurry, Gordon. Oh yeah! Don't leave me here! Antlions, here? Where's that elevator? Oh snap! Somebody shed a tear. More of 'em coming! I need some light. I want you to get out of here as fast as you can. What's the plan? Watch it! We made it, thanks to you! Alyx, oh my god, where's Freeman!?! Oh, there he is... Thanks for covering me, Gordon. Let's keep moving! Dark as hell in here... I've got it right here. It should be here any minute. [Shock sounds] Yes! No loud noises after six o'clock... Uh oh...look at that. The gravity gun is settling down. All right, Dad. I'll see you soon. That should keep them off our backs for a while. We're gonna have to make our way to the commuter train station, and fast. We can only pray they're still running Okay. Across this bridge, over the rooftops, is a safe path to the station. Izzy? [Matt T. Wood] We wanted the crashed train car to be very disorienting. In early tests, though, players felt that it was too confusing and too hard to navigate. That feedback prompted us to tone it down a bit. By rearranging some of the geometry, we were able to create a banged up, tilted environment that still offered a relatively unobstructed path to Alyx. I'm blind as a bat without that flashlight on. God, I hope you don't remember who you were. We stole some information from the Citadel on our way out. Gordon? What is it? Jump! What the hell was that thing? I'll be right behind you. [out of breath...] Cover up the openings! However, this is most likely a temporary state of affairs. As we once learned to our dismay, even the relatively tiny fracture at Black Mesa gave our enemies an opening which they were able to force ever wider, as they poured through in greater and greater numbers. I got this! They're always saying something's about to blow. I ain't buying it this time. What in god's name is that thing? Thank you. Nice shot! They're looking for something... Looks like our first bit of luck. This train should pass near enough to where my father's holding out. Oh no... Remember to reload. Well, it sure looks dead. Maybe you should whack it with the crowbar just in case. I blame Odessa Cubbage... Good work, Gordon! We'll follow when we can. I've worked with electricity a time or two, and I'm pretty sure this sparking wire must be connected to a power supply. I wouldn't recommend using the stairs right now. It's like we stumbled into the Citadel gift shop. Boy, we made a real mess up here. Good boy... [Doug Wood] This is another key vista - this time showing the core. It's a visual payoff for the player's success in getting here and, simultaneously, a way to present the player with a view of the next challenge. Talk about unstable. Okay, Gordon, I'll take the sniper's post and cover you for now. A little extra juice in the right spot Hey, it's Judith. It looks like the Combine intercepted a message. I'm going to grab this-and whatever else I can. I'll get that in a second. It's all so strange... Think it's dead? Maybe you should whack it with the crowbar just in case. Finally, fresh air... Well... I can't believe this. You tell 'em, Doc! How the hell did you get out of the Citadel? Okay... There, Gordon. [out of breath...] What a surprise...zombies. There goes the light... Rollermines! Lead the way, Gordon. I'm not saying good-bye. It's an antlion guard! I'll check this side. Good thinking! Yes. Look out, it's got a grenade! Barney! Over here! We've gotta keep the antlions in control! Try to keep up, okay? Ugh... This way. Shall we? I'm on this! Antlions! Where's he going now? [gasp] I guess that wasn't it... This isn't the time to play! Izzy... Oh God! More zombies! Get away from there! You know the drill. They're everywhere! Come on! We must've found the place where they make these things. Hm...why isn't it moving? The power must be out. They won't be expecting this. Oh my God... Soldiers! Haul ass! You run point, okay? Oh, I hate to think what could have lived comfortably in that thing. Here she comes. Well, Dog, It looks like the citadel is starting to flare up again. We'd better hurry. You've got to be kidding... [Pain sounds] Let's head for the surface. Hey now, are you sure? Damn. Run! What the hell... [Ted Backman] Our art and gameplay standards encourage players to build a visual dictionary that defines how they expect things to work in the Half-Life world. For instance, even though the door to the powerbox room is metal, and would probably have a metal crossbar holding it shut, we barred it with a wooden plank. Because we've been consistent throughout the game, the player should recognize that a wooden plank can be both broken and manipulated with the gravity gun, properties that wouldn't be immediately apparent about a metal bar. We really need to keep going. Now, where's that crank handle? This is hopeless. There's no access. No way to... Let's get these folks to a train. Agh, looks like we're stuck on the milk run. Gordon! Trouble! Gordon! Let's not hang around in here. [Ido Magal] Later in the level, there's a Combine gunner protected behind some metal plates, just like the ones blocking the player's way here. We placed them here as a training tool to remind players that the gravity gun can grab and detach these things. Company! It should be here any minute. Holy crap! I think I know that guy! Bring them out where I can get a clear shot! Uh oh...this one's a mess...could take a bit longer. Yep. This way, Gordon! That stalker is destroying the energy balls. Run! Hurry! Oh no, we missed our train! Get on the back of the train. Get them to the trains! Look around, Gordon! That's how you do it, eh Freeman? Last train. I'm going to cut this short. We may have been spotted. Die! Here's the lift. Get going. Take good care of my girl. I'm counting on you. I hate to do this, but... [Matt T. Wood] In much the same way that movie effects often utilize different versions of the same model, there are actually three trains that make up the stalker scene. The first one is the moving train you see arrive at the platform. The one you're in right now is a static interior with lights moving outside of it to give the illusion of motion. The third train is the crashed version. It's a tilted, banged up, and totally separate area from the moving version. The transition from moving to crashed is disguised by a brief fade to black. Whoof... I think we just broke about fifty Combine regulations. Looks like we're going to need your flashlight after all. Whoa!. What are you doing here? You should have evacuated by now. I'll help you! Look-a stalker. Hey down there! Stop up those burrows and we'll let you through! [Steve Kalning] One of the primary design goals of Episode One was to convey the sense that Alyx and the player are a team. This sniper sequence provides an opportunity for Alyx to offer combat support in a cool new way. It also gives the player a chance to watch zombies get sniped up close and from various angles. You heard the old egghead! Get out of the city! Gordon. Here comes our stop! Get ready! Take that! I'm holding it off Gordon - grab it if you can. Hurry up, before I lose my nerve. [Jim Dose] Before we armed players with traditional weapons, we wanted to give them a chance to appreciate Alyx's combat abilities. Toward that goal, we created a very specific combat style for the early parts of the journey outside the Citadel - dark, tense, surrounded by zombies, and either weaponless or starved for ammo so that players needed to rely on the gravity gun and, more importantly, Alyx. This is where players finally get a weapon. Since the door only opens when the padlock is shot, players can't proceed without finding the pistol. It's effectively a weapon gate - once players are through the door, we can be sure they've got a pistol. Oh my God... What is it? Nice punt! and help us find a way over. Bring that over here and I'll rejigger it. Hey! I'm good! Why are people sticking around? That'll slow them down, Here they come! What's taking so long? Hey! I wanted those! It might be the last one. Oh! Good thinking! They found us! Yeah! Heh, nice job. Ugh.... That's it! Here we go again...again! [Pain sounds] Let's get to that access bridge. Defend us, Freeman! Taking the scenic route, eh? So much for medical supplies [Doug Wood] Along with vistas, positive feedback from Alyx is one of our primary means of rewarding players. In this case, Alyx's excitement over the strider's destruction adds a sense of closure to the battle and gives players the satisfaction that someone witnessed and appreciated their heroics. How 'bout a little help here, Freeman. Careful with that! [out of breath] That was a little too close. Be careful...there might be more of those things around. Hang on... It should be safe for me to come in there...at least till it heats up again. Zombine, get it? Heh heh. Heh. While you're working in there, I'm going to take a shot at hacking their network. Light! Dog! You could've killed us. What has gotten into you? It's my Dad! All right, you two! I'll see you out there! [Fighting sounds] Oh crap. No power. They're all over! Where the hell are we now? Everything looks the same. Careful what you're doing there, Dog...and stop goofing around! Gordon, you're all right. You're supposed to protect us! You might want to charge your flashlight to full first. AIEEE! The containment system's back in place. Good shooting! Or before six for that matter. It's all so strange... I blame Odessa Cubbage... Why's Dog taking so long? Heh! Great shot! I thought we'd never make it. We place our firmest hope in the human spirit, even knowing how easily it may be shattered. We have all seen friends and family crushed by the Combine. Some of our neighbors have allowed themselves to be co-opted, and purged of their humanity, by the military machine. Gordon! Why are they defending this garrison when the whole city's about to blow. You bet. Let's go. Come on, we'll help you if we can. Well, Gordon...unless you have a better suggestion... Dad, please... Get this thing moving! Izzy? [Gautam Babbar] Instead of letting the gunship AI have its own way here, we forced the ship to crash right into the attic. It's a dramatic payoff for winning the battle, and it gives players an opportunity to examine a gunship up close at their leisure. Oh shit! Hey - an airduct. Oh God... Here, bring it closer. This water's nasty. First the Combine...now this! Nice job! Thanks, that was close. Thanks, Alyx. Where are you, Gordon? Shine your light for me. I was hoping we'd get a bit farther before they noticed us again. More of em coming! How much longer on that light? I don't know what's in this copy we made, but they're not thrilled about us having it. Lost it! This way. Ow Tell me about it. They're doing their best to trap us here. Come on! To the stations! We've been spotted! Alyx, are you there? Leave some for me! Knock that stuff out of the air, Gordon! That alone should interest Dad. Ah! There's one! Dr. Kleiner says we can mate now. Not that I needed his permission. Hey, flares! We could use these! Run for it! We made it! [out of breath...] The stalker train took us further than I thought. I was hoping we'd get a bit farther before they noticed us again. I was getting tired of carrying this around. Uhm, brace yourself, Gordon! Are you still there? Get out of the City! The Citadel's going to blow! Go get more citizens, Gordon. Rot in hell! Come here! We'll be careful, Dad. Whoa! [John Guthrie] The darkness in this area has a few real gameplay benefits. It slows the player down, which most of the time keeps Alyx at your side. The claustrophobia, the close in combat, and Alyx's constant presence and reliance on your flashlight help enhance the tension and your sense of camaraderie. In the dark, the limited flashlight battery adds an extra layer of resource management to the tactics of combat. Uh oh. We'd better get out of here. You heard them, Gordon! Get the burrows blocked. We've only bought ourselves a little more time. I'm holding it for you...get aboard. Looks like the reactor's back on track for a meltdown. [Randy Lundeen] We needed a train station, but we didn't want something that was too similar to the one in Half-Life 2. We decided to give this station a more industrial look, to make it a place where trains were repaired and freight was offloaded. We included some Combine elements to help explain why the strider can't fire through the various strategic barricades required by the game design. Doctor Breen - ugh - I hope we've seen the last of him. Get on the train! Hurry! Then you probably know we gotta get going. [Steve Bond] For this climactic battle, we created a new AI that makes the strider a more interesting opponent. It has a snappier cannon attack, can better track the player's movements, and it now has the ability to target the environment in dangerous ways. For instance, its cannon fire can shove heavy shipping containers straight into the player. Help! Huh...looks like we'll have to backtrack. Uh oh... Oh, thank God! Oh boy...they're onto us. I wish there was something else I could do to help. Yeah, yeah, good to see you. Now, where's Dog? *pain* [Bill Van Buren] Our games are created by design collectives that we call 'cabals'. When the idea to have you and Alyx sit in a van and then have Dog toss it across the gorge was first suggested during a cabal meeting, everyone thought it was funny - and then we moved on to more serious solutions for the gorge crossing. As the design progressed, though, we kept coming back to the van idea, and eventually everyone agreed that we should give it a try. Even though the idea was kind of outrageous, it satisfied some key goals we had for the scene: Alyx and the player get across the impassable gorge and Dog is able to play a key role in the mission while also plausibly getting left behind. There were still some problems to solve, though: attaching animated models to the van was tricky, making sure the van didn't kill the player took some thought, and it took a number of tries before we were able to really illuminate Dog's thinking, as he went from testing his idea with chunks of debris to finally presenting the plan to Alyx. Ultimately, we were able to create a scene that solved some tricky game design issues, provided an intimate view of the relationship between Alyx and Dog, and delivered a surprising and visceral entrance to the Citadel. [Robin Walker] We always try to exploit a feature as much as possible throughout a game. For instance, these flares. They're an exploration reward, they've got a simple, satisfying interaction with the gravity gun, and they're a good tactical alternative to the flashlight. Finally, they're a weapon that will ignite zombies, which in turn become a new light source. Sorry to keep you waiting. Looks like we should be able to...damn. Dead end. *laughter* Stalkers again. What the hell are they up to? Those people could use our help! Look out behind you! How much does that suit weigh? Ai! Headcrabs! [Sigh] Get rid of that sniper. Headcrabs! I think they felt that! You don't look too good, Gordon. Ugh... that smell can only mean zombies. Got room for two in there? [Shock sounds] Any ideas? How are they getting into the city? Reloading! One down. [Gary McTaggart] The core sphere was one of the last special effects that we finished. To achieve its effect, the core uses animated textures, flowmaps, normalmapped refraction and specularity, as well as volumetric particulate matter rendering, which takes advantage of the core being a sphere. Hey, that was a good idea. Hurry up, Gordon, we've gotta keep moving. Thatta boy... I'll follow you. [Fighting sounds] Get it away from me! You're supposed to wait till everyone else is on board first. Don't tell me there's only one crank in this whole neighborhood. This must be it. [Shock sounds] Cover its eyes! I gotta catch my breath... I see you've handled that before. Get up! Looks like we're on a good heading. Hurry up, people! I thought you were supposed to help us! Never thought I'd be happy to see those trains again. What's gotten into you, huh? Yikes! These flares could be useful. We got a live one! [Fighting sounds] Take a look. Gordon, you know what'd be cool? Actually, I can't think of anything cooler than what just happened. We still have this garrison to get through. Is that everybody? What took you so long? We made it! Where are they coming from? Well, that wasn't so hard. Here's your elevator [Marc Laidlaw] One thing we try to do when we're integrating storytelling and gameplay, something that has become a hallmark of ours, is to include non-linear bits of narrative - things that action-oriented players don't have to sit through, but that are available to players who want to learn more about the background of the story. Kleiner's broadcasts on the public address monitors are a good example of this method. Apart from the strong visual image of Dr. Kleiner replacing his former boss on the giant screens, his speech conveys a lot of dense information about the state of the world and how things have changed due to the events of Half-Life 2. We settled on this particular location for the Kleinercast as one of the few logical places where players can watch it in peace or move on to the next encounter. It's essentially a footnote embedded in the world. Which makes this a footnote on a footnote. Look at them. Whoa...these readings are off the scale... [Pain sounds] [out of breath...] They know where we are. Cover the burrows, Gordon! Hold on a sec...there's so much interference. I hope it's not too late to reengage the containment field. Ka-blooie! Crap! You hear 'em...underground? Grenade! Uh, do you mind? Maybe we can use it against the sniper. Please... Looks like you know how to handle that thing. Oh God, that was close! Oh all right, damn it, if that's what it takes! Get down! Do your stuff, Gordon. They really don't want us to have this. [Doug Wood] Monitor scenes, such as this video transmission from Dr. Mossman, aren't simply prerendered video. These scenes actually unfold live in an inaccessible section of the map, while being projected onto the monitor screen. Here's Dr. Mossman in the small arctic base set. It's not nearly as far away from the Citadel's core control room as it appears to be in the level. Zombies! These lamps are quite hot! Get ready. Let's go help those people. [Groan like a zombie] Let me bring up another train. Jump on, Gordon! I can hear 'em! That flare's about to go out! [out of breath...] When we figure it out I'll let you know. Man down! Sometime you gotta show me how to do that! Oops, my mistake, I got it. Awesome shot! Let's find the powerbox so we can get out of here. [Pain sounds] Hey, let's get off before the next ride starts. We made it. [Fighting sounds] Kinda makes you wish we were still fighting headcrabs. Reloading! Ah! It's hurting, Gordon! Send out the first group! This could be it, Gordon. At any rate...First, as a matter of great urgency, if you find yourself still within the confines of City 17, you are well advised to leave the city at once by the fastest means available to you. We have restored service to much of the commuter transport system in order to carry citizens out of the city as quickly as possible. We have also established camps and triage areas in the surrounding environs. I really hate zombies. Oh my God... Sound good? Last time through here, I couldn't see a thing. Oh! That was fun! [out of breath...] Nice job! Lost em! I can't wait to see what Dad and Dr. Kleiner make of all the data I got. I don't get it [Pain sounds] Dad? Stop screaming Gordon, defend the citizens! Oh no! Oh, headcrabs! Kleiner! Stop! Can you see any way to get this open? Awesome! Here, take some of my ammo. I'll bring up the next train. Yeah, it's probably a good idea to plug any hole an antlion could squeeze through. Light! [shocked shout] However, not at first hand. Good job kneecapping that strider! I think we can get through here. You okay? Ya, well, we're done with that! No, no, no... it's locked. Oh, that was great! Okay, we'll let you through! Get in! I wonder what they were bringing through here. Take it down! Give it to Gordon. I wondered if you were gonna make it in time. Huh, well, now they're just history. Bingo! [laughing] Gotcha! Okay, so far so good. Why are they hanging around here? They're dying all around me! Oh... Like I said before, if you can keep them safe and provide cover, we might actually stand a chance of reaching the escape trains. Let it go now. Next thing I knew, Dog was digging me out of the rubble. Yeah... Hey, Dog. Give me a hand with this. [out of breath...] They found us! Yeah! If we found a way into the Citadel, it's possible we could--- Dog...really...that was a little close. Well, not quite yet but-but listen, Dad, we found him! Keep moving! God damn the Combine. Get it off me! Get it off! Okay, let's get in. Come on. I need a clear shot, Gordon! I don't have a weapon that'll even scratch that strider. It's up to you. Oh great. There's some kind of cave-in up ahead. Dog! You found Gordon! We missed it, Gordon! Nice shot! Where's that elevator? This is unbelievable... Not you, Freeman! You got a job to do. I thought we'd never make it. Okay, let it loose. Ugh... How are we gonna get through this? Ha ha. Good thing it's open season on gunships. This must be where they made those damn things. He's keeping it shut from the other side. He's alive! He was so sure I wouldn't find you here. Oh, back so soon? How are we going to cut off the antlion supply? These people have no one else to look out for them. I'm dry - reloading. It's too dark! We'll hold them off! You've got to get out of the city, now! Huh? Incoming! I wonder if this wire leads to the fuse box. Lead the way. I think I see a stop down below. Let's get off there and see where it leads. Let's go! They're no match for us! Looks like they were storing something in these pods. Some kind of offloading facility. Hold on a sec. I don't have a weapon that'll even scratch that strider. It's up to you. Okay... No wonder you were one of Dr. Kleiner's prize pupils. Reloading! Oh, hey Freeman. And this is the Missus, I presume? Hit it with another one, Gordon! Everybody keep moving! How 'bout this weather? Well that puts the pressure on. We gotta get moving. What the hell are those things? They won't bother us if we leave them alone. Get in, Gordon! Hold that light steady... Something tells me they don't want us to know what's in this transmission. Oh my God... Uh - I think I'll take the stairs. *laughter* [Wade Schin] Originally, Barney started off in this map in the doorway down by the citizens, but playtesters tended to wander around for a while before stumbling across him. We moved him up here to guarantee that his scene with Alyx would unfold before players began any exploration. He's standing over a dead metrocop because it's a plausible-looking long term activity, in case players don't move directly down to him. Nearby reward items also tend to draw players toward him. I hope you two are here to help. Oh God, that was close! Oh god! We're not exactly sure. It would help us evacuate more citizens.... Okay, Dog, let's do it. I'll never get this done if those antlions keep swarming us. This has been Dr. Isaac Kleiner, formerly of Black Mesa, now simply a citizen, like all of you, of Earth. Coast is clear. Look-a stalker. Let's finish up with that powerbox now! Can you take us there? You go first. Yeah! Uh...I'd really like to apologize for blowing out the lights. Wait a second. You okay? Oh, Gordon! You run point, okay? Oh - they're out of bullets. Sorry about that thing with the lights, Gordon. Oh no...zombies. You're lucky you've got that hazard suit. There we go. Take that! Headcrabs! Whatever's in that transmission packet, Here we go! Get in, Gordon! So that's a headcrab...huh... Anyone left in the vicinity will be subjected to energetic events whose effects are beyond my powers of speculation. Ah, I don't think I could stand to be in here alone. Yeah, well, we've been planning to make a push on the trainstation. Here they come! [Steve Bond] Initially, the player wasn't going to have a weapon here. The combination of no weapon and near total darkness forced the player to use the flashlight to direct Alyx's fire. We liked the idea that you could interact with Alyx in a meaningful way using elements that were already built into the interface. Unfortunately, playtesters didn't like not having a weapon. So we added weapons back in. Luckily, it turned out that, even armed, players tended to still use and enjoy the flashlight mechanic. What the hell? Go! Oh... Lost em! Excellent! What's going on? Let's find Barney I mapped out our escape route. [Greg Coomer] The core was a central element of this part of the game, and, as much as possible, we wanted to constantly reinforce its importance. Zigzagging through the space in three dimensions while navigating a variety of challenges let us present a few different visual and gameplay perspectives on the same space. By letting the player see the core from a bunch of different angles, we were able to give them a real sense of its scale. Follow that electrical cable. See where it leads. Phew. Rot in hell! If you believe in that sort of thing. [Fighting sounds] Don't lose another one, Freeman! If we could block these antlion holes, it might slow them down. We'll, help however we can. Hey! You're Alyx Vance! Hey, what about that one? Alyx - honestly, do you think we have any chance? There it is. Gordon! Thanks... Get back! Well, Dog, He'll be here later. Now let's get the hell outa here. He'll know what to do with it. Well... Hey, what's up? [Matt T. Wood] Training is one of the fundamental tenets of our design philosophy. Before the player is required to utilize some new game mechanic or new weapon, or face a new monster under pressure in a dangerous situation, we always introduce the concept in a relatively calm but ideally still entertaining way. This entire scene teaches the player that Alyx can convert rollermines so that they can be used as a friendly weapon. Later, the player is required to do this in more pressing circumstances, but at this point everything's still pretty calm. In the original design, the player retrieved a rollermine from a dispenser and used it to take out a Combine soldier who was holding the field from the other side. Eventually, we scrapped that idea and combined the rollermine training with some stalker exposition that originally occurred in a separate scene. I can't go out there while that sniper's covering the street. Let me climb up and take a look at what we're walking into. The core control room is just ahead. Careful. Hold it steady. Damn. Now, come here. Look over here. [Bill Fletcher] Monitor scenes are especially difficult to make interesting, since they tend to involve literally just talking heads. By interweaving critical expository information - like how dangerous the Citadel has become - with some dramatic character interactions between Alyx, Eli, and Dr. Kleiner, we were able to convert a potential liability into one of the strongest scenes in the game. A great way to illustrate characters' relationships to each other is to have one of the characters in danger and show the others' reactions to it, which is what this scene is all about. Well, that was pretty nuts. First the Combine...now this! Okay, let's head for the next yard! Wait a second. It looks like this will take us out of the city. How 'bout we get off the street for a while. Kinda makes you wish we were still fighting headcrabs. What's that? Let's take em down! It's all you, Gordon. Ka-boom! That's better...I can hear myself think. Wait'll he hears that we found you. Oh! Thanks for getting them off me! [Pain sounds] You're my new hero! Wait a sec...gotta build a charge on my end. I doubt we'd have made it in time. Hey! Good shooting! That stalker is making things tough. Hurry, Gordon! Hey, did you hear something? Shine your light over here. No! The Combine's not making it easy. We're trying to get enough people together to force our way through to the trainstation. People are meeting up in a safehouse nearby. [John Guthrie] This is where some player training pays off. After earlier training players on the use of ballsockets, they get a sort of 'live fire' test here starting the elevator. This is the beginning of this level's puzzle arc, where a basic gameplay mechanic is made increasingly more complex by layering other puzzle elements on it. This first puzzle only requires that the player find a combine ball and put it in the socket. Light! Do you see it? It's light! She's in serious trouble. Damn these things! I hope people are listening... Let me finish this. [Randy Lundeen] We decided this space needed to look unique and appear to have more significance than the rest of the Citadel areas the player had already traveled through, while at the same time feeling as though it was still made with Combine technology. This room introduces a story point that plays a big role in Episode Two, so the player has to feel like something important is going on in here. A different fog setting as well as different light styles and configurations helped achieve this. The red lighting is a good contrast to the traditional blue/green colors of the Citadel. What's this? To the trains, people! We'll make sure you get there safe and sound! Those phones haven't worked in years. Looks like they left a rear guard behind. Have to let this cycle up. Hey O----kay. He says he took me on it once, but I don't remember. [Ken Birdwell] When we designed the Half-Life 2 facial system back in 2000, our goal was to get a natural looking performance at a moderate distance. Given our realtime polygon and texture budgets, we chose fairly reserved or constrained performance over ever having the actors faces get into a bad looking or unnatural expression. For Episode One, we wanted to extend the characters' facial systems to support more intense performances with a wider range of facial expressions, that would hold up better at close range. These facial improvements included increasing the detail around the eyes and mouth, increasing the number of facial shape targets - think of these as movements of muscle groups - by about 50%, rewriting the rules that control how these shapes blend, and increasing the intensity of many of our existing shapes. In addition, we added support for controlling the amplitude of the facial movement for lip-sync animation, which let us dampen or amplify the mouth shapes based on the volume or intensity of the dialogue. Steady on it! Come on, get out of there! Oh my God... Hey! Over here! But what about you, Barney? Quick, now...let's get the train moving. [Hearing zombies] And here comes trouble. I think we're coming to the last stop. A room sweeper like this might be useful in here. You should get out of here. This could be it, Gordon. We're sitting ducks in here. Or maybe fish in a barrel. Anyway, it's not good. What the hell is that? All right That was really something, Doc! Again! Let's keep moving. This was such a nice neighborhood too. This...might work. This train's not going anywhere until we get the power on. *laughter* Good thinking! We've got to figure out how to get over to the Citadel. These things suck! Okay, let's go. Hm.... All right, let me get access for you. Stop Why didn't they leave with the rest of the Combine? *laughter* Great shot, Doc! Come on, people! Those antlions are trapped back there...good thing, too. Oh...thank God...it's just an old recording. Come on, Gordon. Watch the drop. I heard two people were coming up. I'm gonna wait till you're both here. Any time now... Gordon! We've got to hurry, Dog. We're running out of time. Ready? You scared the hell out of me. [Laura Dubuk] To make the set of empty corridors look like a hospital, we chose some iconic hospital props that could be used multiple times throughout the level. Then we built the models with details, multiple skins, and vertical and horizontal elements that would be visually interesting in the space. How 'bout a little help here, Vance. Look out, it's gonna unload! Come on, people. Let's see if we can find a way through the control room. Get that soldier! The one with the rocket launcher! What is this place? Don't lose another one, Freeman! Fantastic ass-kicking, Doc! Need some light! What's with that smell? Open the gate! Keep that antlion lit for me. Hit it before it makes another pass! We're gonna see if we can help anyone else get out. [Matt T. Wood] To convey a sense of urgency, we originally designed Alyx to nag the player pretty frequently. She'd say things like 'Hurry up!' and 'Keep moving!' Whether or not this created a sense of urgency is debatable. But after about three minutes of this, the one thing it definitely did was make the player hate Alyx. This was one of the observations that eventually led us to switch Alyx from generally leading players to almost always following. Through playtesting we discovered that players much preferred to set the pace themselves and that they especially disliked virtually any hint of bossiness from Alyx. Hold on. There must be some way to open this gate. Was it something I said? Although, I suppose we really should send a foray party for specimens at some point after the event. Gordon? The elevator's almost here...we just gotta hold out a little bit longer. Tell me about it. They're doing their best to trap us here. Hold it! It's pulling everything in! Don't get held up-we've gotta get to the trainstation. Did you see that? It's Judith. That's right! Take out that sniper, Gordon! Light em up! This is our train. [Fighting sounds] Okay, Dog, go get the monitor set up so we can check in with my Dad. Good. Now, to catch up on those beating quotas. That wire is sparking, it must lead to the fuse box. You're gonna want to keep moving. [Pain sounds] We have made, in secret, several technological advances which we will do our best to deploy in advance of the Combine's return. Heh...this ought to be interesting. Take it down! We'll follow when we can. You can do better than that! Um... no, my dad's Odessa Cubbage. Go back to Barney and get another group. My ears are ringing... You need to find some health kits. Let's go! Hurry! They're not going to let us alone. Watch your step, Gordon! Shit! Something's coming! What the hell did you just do? Got it. Let me just add to all those who can hear me now, as we struggle out of the shadow of our malefactors, welcome back to the light. It's working. From the rooftops! Sounds like it's getting closer. Oh hell, it looks like that soldier found himself a rocket launcher. Climb on, Gordon! Over there! A host body? You must be joking, I can't possibly--- Here, have a medkit. Ah! It's hurting, Gordon! What was that? Ugh... Let's see if we can find a powerbox. Hey, the gravity gun's back to normal. They're coming from the rooftops! Well, actually, we're still at the citadel. You just worry about getting on that train. Look at that... Not anymore. [Gabe Newell] Welcome to Half-Life 2, Episode One. We received a great deal of positive feedback on the commentary track in The Lost Coast, and so we've included the same feature in this episode. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your use key. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press the use key again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your use key again to stop the commentary. With episodic content, we are hoping to release games much more frequently than has been possible with the monolithic development schedules of the past. Game developers and game customers have been wanting to try this for years. Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play this, our latest installment in the ongoing adventures of Gordon Freeman. I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com. Thanks, and have fun! Uh oh... I wonder what the - Hm! Lost em! Any luck figuring out how to get the power back on? Run! Hurry Gordon, I'm We're all just targets to them now. [Shock sounds] Keep 'em coming! The flare. Gordon, I... Not you, Freeman! You got a job to do. Any luck figuring out how to get the power back on? Should be safe for me to come in now. Here's where we get off. Huh. Looks like I might be able to give it a jolt-enough to get the door open anyway. Thank you! [Randy Lundeen] The post-Half-Life 2 look of City 17 was difficult to nail down and went through many changes. We wanted to establish several things; Primarily that this was a different part of the same city with a slightly different atmosphere and that it had been severely damaged. This street was a test bed for a lot of our visual design work. First, we built an intact city street and then we beat up certain buildings, in some cases removing them entirely so that more destruction was visible in the distance. We did an initial lighting pass in the game engine, and then took screenshots of various locations. Using Photoshop, we manipulated those screenshots to establish a color scheme. Photoshop lets us quickly iterate through all kinds of skies, lighting styles, and color schemes. The environmental lighting colors that we ended up with were based on some photo references of the sun filtering through the smoke from a forest fire. Some falling ash effects and a closer-than-usual fog plane helped sell the effect. We're working on it. Is that light I can see up there? What? *pain* Keep moving! Stay close to us, Dog. Let's do it, Gordon. Is something wrong? I made it! We can leave now! Keep moving! Hey - there's a guard holding it in place. Let's get out of here. Now that's the Gordon Freeman I know! [Pain sounds] We'll go throw the power switch, Barney. There you are. I thought you might have forgotten about me. We are rapidly approaching the point of no return. What? Careful, I can't see a thing. The manner in which these exceedingly rare quantum effects percolate up into the physical plane will be fascinating to witness- Alyx is well out of harm's way by now. Leave some for me! [Yahn Bernier] It's really important to us to create scenes that showcase strong relationships between our characters. The relationship between Alyx and Dog seems to be especially satisfying to players. In the scene leading up to the van toss, we had a bug before the animation was complete where Dog's head would shake as he looked back at Alyx. In a happy accident, his head shook right after she asked him, 'You did do the math, right?' In playtests, players thought this was intentional and always laughed. Because of that, we worked it into the animation and it ended up being a terrific little moment between Dog and Alyx. Keep it from hitting us! They can't hear us, I guess. I'm trying to find a way in there, now quit goofing around. Die! you and Barney used to compete to see who could get in fastest without using a key. What went on in here? Gordon! Got a problem! Uh-oh... here we go again. Damn. See if you can find a rollermine, Gordon. Damn it! I can't unlock this one because- The ravages to cellular material are unimaginable. Oh shit! Don't get held up-we've gotta get to the trainstation. We made it. Traitor! We gotta get outta here! My God. This place is really coming apart. You go on without us, Barney. Those people aren't going to make it without your help. Oh no...not again. That thing's gonna chew us up! We don't have time to look for another way around. After you... Right. *laughter* The train's filling up-good job! This way. Damn. The doors are stuck. See if you can find some way to pull them open. Hey Gordon, I need some light! We need to get across here. Nice shot. Careful - I hear turrets. Okay, Dog, let's get the monitor setup so we can check in. Oh, my Father! This must be the Combine's Most Wanted list... That was a close one. Well, they shouldn't bother us if we leave them alone. Take out that stalker if you have to, we need to get moving. I need light over here. I can't come with you until that sniper's out of the picture. Run for the trains! Dr. Freeman's gonna make sure you don't come to any harm! Look at the gravity gun! What the hell is it doing? It's still out there! I'll hit the streets and round up everyone who's been waiting. Damn these things! Empty - reloading. What do you think? Striders really tore the hell out of this place... Well, that's not going to work. [John Guthrie] This space was designed to lure players onto a section of breakable floor that drops them into a room full of zombies. Players are enticed into the trap by some reward items and a chance to peek into a hole. We like to surprise players, but we never want them to feel that they've been treated unfairly. Hey, you with me? Ah! Gordon! We're gonna miss our train! [Sigh] Let's hope the worst is over. Go ahead and pitch it through the field. Rot in hell! If you believe in that sort of thing. Lost my target! I'm on it! Izzy... Wait'll he hears the great news. Okay, you did it. Bring me a rollermine, Gordon. How 'bout a little help here, Vance. I'll cover you from up here, then you can open the gate and cover me while I catch up. Fellow citizens...residents of City 17 and environs...by which I mean sentient residents, of course, human and otherwise, although I believe there is little need to explain recent developments to our vortigaunt allies... Help! Since this is in fact the first opportunity we have had to speak openly of the baleful influence of the Combine, there is much ground to cover-and in fact I hope to institute a series of useful bulletins in the days ahead. However, for now, we will have to content ourselves with some relatively meager exposition. Try again. Whew! Everything we do seems to make things worse. Good going! They're coming out of those holes! Push it out through the forcefield. There! Got it! Gordon, where are you? Where'd that light go? Reloading! [Bill Fletcher] Creating a believable, interesting relationship between Gordon and Alyx is made a lot tougher by the fact that Gordon never talks. This elevator scene presented a nice little opportunity to have Alyx express some emotion in a situation where Gordon isn't really in a position to respond. I've never been happier to see Dr. Kleiner! Dog! I'm back. Come on. Keep pummeling it! Damn - I can't get it any clearer. I'll cover you from up here till you reach the far end. Let's find that train. Thanks. You ok? We're surrounded! Thanks for getting them off me! Hurry back. Cover up the openings! Oh, now what? A Strider? What next? Hey - what's happening to the gravity gun? Make for the trains! Ha, you did it! [Bill Fletcher] Players love Dog, so we made sure that he was the first thing you see when you wake up in Episode One. We also wanted players to get a glimpse of the crippled Citadel. When Dog lifts you out of the rubble, it's one of the few instances in the game where we take control of the player's view. This allowed us to ensure the player's view lingered briefly on the Citadel before Dog set them down. [Adrian Finol] It's important that monsters get very deliberate introductions since players are going to interact with them a lot. Generally, we let the player first see a new monster in a safe environment, so that they can start thinking about it before they have to fight it. We gotta hurry. If there's anyone left in the city, we'll try and help them out. We need to hurry. Hey - grab that rollermine. Pay attention-these people need us! Hey, see if you can bring that strider to its knees, buddy. Damn. This thing is jammed. I hate to leave it. Good thinking! Whoa! It's moving. You go ahead. You bet! Good job, Gordon! I'll be right there. Oh boy...they're onto us. Bye Barney! Everybody keep moving! They know where we are. Clear the path here, Dog. I'll cover you from up here till you reach the far end. Maybe this console has some useful information. Uhm, haven't we been this way before? I blame Black Mesa... Nice thinking. Look out! Thank you. Ya! Burn em! Is that Doctor Kleiner? [John Guthrie] Poison headcrabs are ideal for ambushes, because they startle you, but can't actually kill you. Here, after a series of right hand turns, you round a corner into a dead end. While you're cracking open a box of goodies, you're ambushed by a poison headcrab. Constructing the ambush this way increased the odds that you wouldn't see the crab, but would hear it just in time to turn around as it leapt at your head. I can't move this mounted gun. I'll cover you from up here. You ready? There's supposed to be an elevator right through here.... Phew - glad that's over. Careful with that. They're through the door! It'll do the rest. Okay...here we go.... [Bill Fletcher] Alyx's reactions to the Stalkers went through a number of iterations. In very early versions, Alyx was frightened by the Stalkers. That didn't work because it didn't fit with Alyx's earlier reactions to Stalkers in the Citadel. We changed it so that she expressed anger at the Stalkers' predicament. Early versions of this new direction failed because Alyx's transition from generally upbeat to blind rage was simply too abrupt. Ultimately, through rewrites and rigorous testing, we found the right tone for the scene - a simmering anger level that was more in tune with the situation. Before I change my--- Dog...Dog.... I hate bugs! If you can find a powerbox, I can get the door open. We've got to find a way down to the core. They might call 'em crabs, but I'll tell you what, they don't taste like crab. Kill it! Little to the right... Where'd you go? This car looks empty. Nothing but cargo. Hmm. [Steve Bond] We noticed during playtesting that players were often too afraid of the strider's weapons to stand in front of it and fire rockets. This was kind of a problem because rockets are virtually the only way to kill a strider. To help players, we modified the strider's AI so that a player-launched rocket will significantly delay the strider's attack. This 'battle of reflexes' lets players guide their missiles in safety, as long as they get their shot off before the strider does. I cannot believe we're trying to get back in that place. Yap, yap, yap, why don't you let Freeman get a word in for once? Hey! Over here! It's working. Have your papers out and available. Phew. I'm not going nowhere. No sir. We're ready for another group of citizens. Light please! Here we go again. We're not exactly sure. We're gonna run out of bullets before this burrow runs out of antlions! Ha! Ha! Burn em! Zombies! Why are we stopping here? When the coast is clear, I'll catch up. [Matt T. Wood] The primary goal of the first Citadel map is to communicate to players that the Citadel is falling apart. The vortex was a late addition to the map in an effort to beef up the idea that the Citadel was becoming a very dangerous place. We had particular difficulty in conveying the 'danger zone' here. In early playtests, players thought that the entire bridge was dangerous at all times. Some additional effects work helped let players know where the dangerous areas were. We would have loved to base more gameplay on this vortex idea, but we just didn't have the time. Ugh...a barnacle. Light it up for me, Gordon. Hurry up! Oh well...it was out of gas anyway. Look alive! [Jason Deakins] The antlion hole training is unusual, because it requires the player to learn a new skill in combat. This is a rare case where training occurs under duress, so Alyx states the problem and helps in the fight without giving away the solution. Now stay with us... Get in, Gordon. Ugh... You coming? Jump! Did you hear something? We're getting out as fast as we can! Oh my god... [Pain sounds] Come on, Gordon, we need to keep moving. I hear it's a lot better out in the country. I'm with you. At least the antlions hate the Combine as much as they hate us. What the hell is that? Like it was in Breen's reactor. See if you can move some of that debris. I hate these cramped spaces... Knock that stuff out of the way before it hits us! Just tell us where you want us. It doesn't sound like we have any choice. [Marc Laidlaw] Right off the bat, we needed to hammer home some story points, reintroduce the cast of characters, and explain the player's immediate goal. It was a pretty intimidating chunk of non-interactive exposition. We generally approach these scenes by writing way too much, and then, through constant playtesting, trimming the scene to more manageable levels. In this case, even after some heroic pruning, the opening scene still felt too long. We ended up splitting the introductory sequence into three scenes, separated by some gravity gun puzzle solving and then a dramatic walk across a crumbling ledge. How exactly is this supposed to help us? Heh - that's the million dollar question. How are you, Barney? They killed the new guy! There it is. [Robin Walker] Character AI is all about putting on a good show. As we neared the end of production, we were still unhappy with the way that Alyx handled herself in combat. The most common thing she did was to run backwards while shooting at enemies. It was realistic, but boring. We added crouching and aiming at the last minute, and though it didn't change her combat effectiveness in any functional way, it made her a whole lot more fun to watch. This is a great example of how relatively minor presentation and behavior changes can have a major impact on entertainment value. Is he? Come on, Gordon, as soon as they're out of here, let's free up the next train. Well, they shouldn't bother us if we leave them alone. Trouble! Sorry, guys! Take care! Here we go. [Pain sounds] That was the weirdest pain I've ever felt... It looks like it did in Breen's portal reactor. Hm. Overwatch soldiers! Gordon! Blam! Where are you? At least the antlions hate the Combine as much as they hate us. [Scott Dalton] Having trained the player that balls fit into sockets, we wanted to introduce a puzzle where the question was HOW to get the ball into the socket. The puzzle we came up with involved a socket with an object blocking it, so that the player would have to ricochet the ball into place. That sounded simple until we actually tried to implement it. If we made the covering opaque, playtesters didn't realize that there was a socket behind it. When we made it translucent, they often didn't see it was there and were confused when their shot bounced off. Making it movable was a red herring making people think they could knock it away. A couple of subtle art changes helped. We added some more prominent shadowing and made the glass panel flash whenever it was hit with a ball. Some playtesters consistently searched for a position to get a direct shot, which we didn't discourage as an alternate solution. It looks like you've saved our lives again. [Chris Green] Episode One is our first project to use HDR lighting heavily in dark, indoor environments. The interaction between the flashlight and the auto-exposure calculations done for HDR presented a real technical challenge. In dark areas where the flashlight was the only source of illumination, we found that we'd often end up with grossly over-exposed views. We ended up compensating for this by using a different set of exposure parameters when the flashlight was turned on. In particular, we drastically shrunk the region of the screen examined for exposure calculations, which permitted us to concentrate only on the much smaller area lit by the flashlight. This way! It's still out there! Yeah. [Bill Fletcher] This is another multipurpose scene. First, Alyx is visibly shaken, which once again humanizes her. But she also states the player's goal for the second half of the game: climb to the surface and get to the train station. As if regular zombies weren't bad enough. I hate bugs! I'm getting the hang of this. Let's see where this train is headed. Go ahead. Oh god help. Look out! Whew! That was close! Oh hell, Gordon! The containment system's back in place. I've secured an exit elevator. [Kelly Bailey] The soundtrack here was created for the introduction of a new adversary, the Combine zombie, or Zombine. Dischordant guitar tones and bends, and a low-fi, fast beat work in the background of this encounter to create an off balance and disturbing mood. We've got to find a way down to the core. Good job! Look out! Rocket launcher. Ugh, dark as hell in here... Fantastic job, Gordon! Hm! Lost it! But not for long. These people didn't have a choice. See that barricade up ahead? Help! Don't let them near you! Um, yeah right. Let's go! Behind you! Don't let that thing get ahold of your head! Hey thanks! No! We need to get this and the transmission packet to my Dad. I'm glad we're doing this together. [Gautam Babbar] Too much of the same type of uninterrupted gameplay causes fatigue. Through repeated playtests, we learned that by the time players reached this part of the hospital, they were ready for a break from intense combat. In response to that feedback, we inserted this relatively calm exploration puzzle as a change of pace. It gives players a respite from combat while still presenting them with an interesting challenge. We're all starving and Kleiner's headcrab's probably eating Grade A head. We'll come with you. We've got to keep these people safe. Don't let them near you! [Robin Walker] We designed this area to be an entertaining showcase for NPC combat. Because of our dynamic AI, these kinds of battles never play out the same way twice. Players often like to sit back, watch the show, and then dive into the fray at their own discretion. We also felt it was time to introduce a new combat ability for Alyx, so we gave her a shotgun here. Not only are shotguns terrific for zombie hunting, their size and ponderous handling characteristics make for some great combat animations. Thanks, Freeman! Heh, well that was fun. Heh... You don't have to ask me twice. Let's go. This way. There are some more coming out over there! Where're you going? Where are these things coming from? Well, it'll all be over soon. Hold that closer to me. Oh my god! Stop up the opening, Gordon! Go for the gunship, Doc! You're going to have to stabilize the reactor one level at a time. Dog, you found him! Gordon! Over to you,Gordon. Oh my god. Stalkers. [Fighting sounds] Ka-blooie! What did you expect? [Ido Magal] We wrestled with the problem of plausibly repopulating this area with soldiers between each trip. After several iterations, we decided to have the soldiers jump in through some high windows. This solution has several advantages beyond maintaining a credible fiction. It makes the incoming enemies more immediately visible and, since the windows are unreachable from the ground, players aren't able to exit through them. Plus, leaping soldiers turn into tumbling ragdolls when shot, which is always entertaining. Good, keep the light over there. Keep them safe! They're no more human than you. Woo hoo! We've stalled out again. Okay, Gordon, get in. Oh no...look up! Hey, up there! Hello! Can you let us out of here? Hello! Heh, good thing. We need all the help we can get. I'll miss you too. [Randy Lundeen] We created a new Citadel destruction set of 'broken' Combine panels and prefabs for the interior spaces to help make the Citadel look like it was on the verge of exploding. We also introduced a strong ambient orange color to help sell the fact that the Citadel was in a much different state from the last time the player passed through. The orange atmosphere was justified due to all the fires and smoke inside the Citadel. What the hell is that? Whoa, hehe..well, that fun. Everything we do seems to make things worse. It won't last forever, but at least we've bought a little time. Damn, I have to start again. This is gonna sound crazy, but I kinda miss the Combine. Hold it out where I can get at it. Give me some light so I can check out the lock. Look at them, Gordon. I wonder if they're trying to escape, or if they just don't know what's happening. *pain* Uh oh... You found Gordon? Here they come. Look out! ... What is it this time? Gordon and I will figure a way out...catch a Combine train or something. What's it doing? Dog? Ah! Damn! I hear it's a lot better out in the country. Was that you? [Seething] Block up the antlion burrows. You need something? Okay, I see you. [Scott Dalton] The light bridge ball sockets are a clear example of our training approach to new gameplay elements. We train players with a leading example, confirm they understand the concept, then switch up the problem set and make them use it in a new way. The first bridge shows players the solution, the second one confirms they understand, the third, knowing they understand the gameplay mechanic, challenges them in a new way using that mechanism. A little help here, Gordon? Holy Crap - Help! Come on. Here we go. Look out! ... Stalkers. Get rid of the APCs! There it goes. I hope Doctor Kleiner was right about this. We're pinned down. We need some way to take out those gunners. After you, Gordon. The train's slowing down. What is this place? Gordon! Damn, they're empty! Agh Uh oh...that was the only thing holding the antlions back. There's something else. It's this way! A better question is why aren't you at the trains yet. Huh? Let's get moving! I'm not going nowhere. No sir. Hey, Gordon? There's a bunch of em! Well...it was nice while it lasted. [Matt T. Wood] In an early version of this map, Alyx led the player through the whole thing. To make Alyx seem less omniscient, we had her access a console here to 'get her bearings'. It exploded, which helped drive home the point that the Citadel was in bad shape, but, generally, it was a long pause in the action without a lot of payoff. After we made the high level decision to have Alyx follow the player, this entire scene became irrelevant, and we happily cut the whole thing. Can't see a damn thing! Are you coming, Dog? I don't want to give up, but we're down to the wire. Aren't you going to speak up for me, Gordon? You're alive! Oh... [Gautam Babbar] We generally design and prototype the basic gameplay in a level before we apply much art to it. Throughout the first several months of playtesting this garage map, the geometry was nothing more than basic shapes and textures. After we'd finalized most of the gameplay elements, we began to flesh out the visuals for the area. For this level, we left the office and took reference pictures of various garages. From these shots, we pulled out everything we liked and that we thought we could pull off well. We combined these visual highlights into what we call a 'styleguide map', which is a standalone map with no gameplay that we use strictly as a visual reference. For this level, we actually made two styleguides - one a destroyed garage, the other intact. After the look was established, we brought the playable map's visual quality up to the level of the styleguides. Often, a map's geometry needs to be changed as the art goes in because areas that worked in the abstract version no longer make sense in a map that now looks like a real place. For instance, the side rooms where two of the cars are hidden were moved several times in order to make them feel more naturally part of a parking garage. Think you can find me one, Gordon? What's wrong with this lift? Why haven't they left already? Grab one of those rollermines, Gordon. Why are we stopping? This was such a nice neighborhood too. [Pain sounds] Hey, Dog. Give me a hand over here. You're Kleiner's daughter, right? Flares! Bet these last longer than your flashlight! Antlions never got into the city in the old days. I mean, last week. Yeah. Look at this, Gordon--the whole Combine war machine is going on as if nothing's happened. Is that everybody? Did you see that? A gunship? And it's on our side. It's getting too dangerous here, Barney. Here goes... What the hell is that? I'm the person who's telling you to get moving. Come on. Shall we? Good! the city's defenses are definitely down. I think Dog needs a few bolts tightened. There's got to be a terminal around here somewhere. We'd better make sure we're on this train. There might not be any others. Oh god...I'm next...I just know it... [Jay Stelly] The Citadel is supposed to be a building of unprecedented scale - so out of scale with the rest of the world, in fact, that we couldn't render it without our 3d skybox technology. This technology allows us to build the Citadel as a 1/16th scale model off in an unreachable corner of the map and seamlessly merge it into the scene. We also use this technology to create the illusion of vast spaces and distant horizons. Let's head upstairs. What about... Someone's firing! Let me disable this field. Move it around till the signal clears. We're gonna see if we can help anyone else get out. Oh shit! Alyx, Gordon - thank God you made it! Ammo's in short supply; a lot of the citizens are unarmed at this point. Were you followed again? I'll leave it to you. Oh no, Gordon. What? People must have been hiding down here... Thanks for getting them off me! Get in the passenger side, Gordon. Ha, I don't believe it. I think we're actually gonna make it out of here... Watch yourself, Gordon. Good shot! Nice shot. Got a problem! Okay then. Take care of yourselves. I'll see you out there. Can you make that jump? Is this elevator going to stop at every floor? Why don't you make a run for it. [Chet Faliszek] We wanted to keep the tension high in this fight, but we also realized that players would need some cover. These destructible panels satisfied both of those design goals. Effectively, they're timed shelters. Players can hide behind the panels, but the strider will target them until they're destroyed. This gives players brief periods of safety during which they can plan their next move. Hm? Don't let me down, Gordon. Gordon! Got him! Same as last time, Gordon. Let's get this bridge down. Not bad, not bad. I hate these things! Check your ammo. Aim for the strider! Nicely done Yeah. Ah! Lost it! Whoa! Come on! That's it - I'm pissed! Watch yourself...you don't look too good. Take these folks to the train and keep em safe! Gordon, where'd you get to? [Shock sounds] We made it! Ugh... Rollermines! Nice toss, Gordon. Up there! Look at 'em all! Look out, it's gonna unload! Oh! I'll stay here and point people toward the train. Careful, boy. I'll be close. Okay, we've gotta take out that armored personnel carrier or no one will be able to get through. Great shooting! Come on, come on! Did you say something? We've been trying to reach him for hours. Heh. Yup. That was close. Oh man, these guys have no idea what they're in for... That's one less gunship in the world! I'm out! Here we go. Nice going! I can hack it to go after Combine targets and leave us alone. Don't damage Combine property. [out of breath...] Oh god...I'm next...I just know it... Hey, a scanner! Hmm. [under her voice] You did do the math, right? Oh god oh god oh god... No more...no more...we've gotta get out of here. Hit it before it makes another pass! What's that beeping sound. I'll cover the street while you figure this out. Okay, you did it. Should be safe for me to come in now. *laughter* O-kay... Well, maybe later. [Erik Johnson] This shipping container used to be accessible only after the player destroyed a padlock. Given the amount of stress during this part of the game, even a simple puzzle (in this case, destroying a lock) would be completely missed by the player. In the end, we felt like the arena we had built for the player to fight the strider was fun enough without this added element, so we removed it. I hope it's still light out. Lure them into the open, Gordon! I don't know what it is yet, Whatever that was...it's gone now... Can't see it! Over there! That was... Dog, where are you going? It's this way. We're getting out as fast as we can! Great shot! Train's just about full. But destroying the Citadel is just a side effect. Yeah, and that's Doctor Freeman in the suit. You lucky dog you. Go on, Barney! They're not after you. All I know is the vortigaunts had something to do with it. Oh my god. [Fighting sounds] Come on, Gordon, this whole place is crumbling...we've got to get to the core. Hurry, Dog. Hurry. That's it - I'm pissed! *laughter* Watch those barnacles. Let me shut this field down so we can get the hell out. It's moving. We need to get power to the bridge generator. But how? Heh... we wondered when you were gonna be done in there. We're all gonna die! Hey, get that light back on! Look! An elevator shaft! So much for sneaking in. Hey! Good idea! There's a Combine garrison at the end of this street. You run point, and then I'll follow as soon as I see you've made it through. Look out! Let it charge for a while, I'll wait. Need that light! Come on, the train's waiting. There's supposed to be an elevator right through here.... Damn. Well, we'll have to find another way around. [Randy Lundeen] The higher contrast white Combine motif of the core sets it apart from the rest of the Citadel and heightens its importance within the visual style of Combine aesthetics. It also helps enhance the sense of heat and radiation in the space. I'm still not sure how we got down from there. It's all mixed up in my head. Anyway, we gotta get moving. [John Guthrie] At one point, this was the site of a physically simulated elevator puzzle. It was kind of neat, but it caused a lot of problems in playtests. Even though the puzzle mostly obeyed the laws of physics, it wasn't at all in line the with the way we'd trained players to expect elevators to work in our world. We considered adding some earlier training to support it, but quickly abandoned the idea in favor of a redesign that was more immediately understandable while still being fun. Shall we go? Let there be... Get away from the doors! I'm sorry, Eli, but I don't see any other way. They're everywhere! How are they getting into the city? [John Morello] Late in development, we changed the art for these doors so that players understood that they were entering the core area. It turned out that having Alyx talk about the area wasn't enough to give playtesters the sense that they'd finally arrived at the core. Hold it out to me. Dad? Watch it, they're everywhere! Uh, I hate to spoil a reunion, but we *really* have to get moving. What the hell is that? It was touch and go for a minute there. Give me some light and I'll see what I can do. Okay, where the hell did that strider come from? I thought they'd all hightailed it out of town by now. Ka-boom! One more like that! We're too exposed out here! Come on! Hey, reload while you have a chance. Hey - bring that rollermine to me. Oh! I'm getting the hang of this. Uh oh...charging your flashlight again? Who are you again? Alyx, Gordon - thank God you made it! [Fighting sounds] Keep it away! We could be out of contact while you're in...at least until you shut it down. Can I get a little more light here, Gordon? If I know Barney, he's in the middle of it. Alyx, where are you? Ahem...is this on? Yes? Very well, I...I am not much of a public speaker, but I'll...I'll do my best. Uh oh...they've got the street fortified up ahead. Gordon! Our ride's waiting! Oh no! [Pain sounds] Another's coming! Need some light! It's me you should be concerned about! I can still deliver Earth, but not without your help. Hey, Dog, what have you got over there? [Shock sounds] Great shot, Doc! We gotta take it down! I can't see a thing in here. Come on! I can't believe it! How 'bout a little help here, Freeman. They could help us get out of here. He is a robot. He's done the math. [Ido Magal] Tripmine traps are great, but they were sort of hard to justify given the total chaos of City 17. Even though we couldn't use tripmines a lot, they made sense in this interrupted ambush scene. Between you and me, I don't trust those Vortigaunts. I'm not sure what you're doing in there, but it's working. Oh my God... Oh no...not one of those! You okay up there, Dog? It would appear an inevitability that very soon now, the Citadel will be consumed in a destructive event whose magnitude I cannot currently estimate with any certainty, except to say that it will almost certainly irradiate an area of many miles' radius. Sometime you gotta show me how to do that! They're coming from above! One more! Okay, Dog, let's get the monitor setup so we can check in. My Dad must be worried sick about us. Take that! Come here! [Doug Wood] There are some little practical details that take a surprising amount of time and testing to get just right. For instance, it took us many playtests to figure out how fast Alyx should move. It turns out that her following behavior looks and feels the best when she's moving faster than the player's normal speed, but slower than the player's sprint speed. The Combine's defense field must have collapsed. Let's make sure we're on it. Doctor Kleiner says whenever he locked himself out of his office Check for survivors, Gordon--anyone hiding. Here comes a big one! [Gary McTaggart] We used an upgrade of the refract shader from Half-Life 2 to make the Vortigaunts warp into the intro. The major difference is that this time we are refracting only pixels that come from the Vortigaunts themselves. We placed a large sheet of refractive geometry in front of each Vortigaunt to achieve this effect. [Shock sounds] Ah - we're here. Careful! As if regular bugs weren't bad enough... Gordon! Soldiers! Just another few seconds. One second... Ugh! Barnacles! I wonder how things are outside the city. [Pain sounds] Good shot. Take out that gunship, Doc! As soon as they're out of here, we'll free up the next train. I see it! Let's wait till it recharges. Boom! [Steve Bond] In a good puzzle, the player is presented with an overall goal and then faces a number of smaller challenges in pursuit of that goal. In the case of the Stalker puzzle, we start with 'How do I open the door?' From there we move to 'How do I get to the Stalker?', then to 'How do I get to the rollermines?', 'How do I get the rollermine back to Alyx?', and, finally, 'How do I use the rollermine to disable the stalker?' Ah, Gordon, please...cover it up. What're you doing up here? That one's gonna blow! Gordon's free to say whatever he wants. Gordon? Nice shooting! I can't believe the stuff they're streaming...Dr. Kleiner's going to have a field day with this. We've gotta get out of here. I can't stand being shut in these places. [Gautam Babbar] The door-banging zombies were supposed to give players a safe glimpse of a threat they'd have to face later in the level. In the original design, players couldn't open the door; The zombies would burst through on their own after the player had done a little exploring. We abandoned that plan when many playtesters exhibited a pretty much singleminded fascination with opening the door as soon as they saw it. We made the door openable, though if players ignore it the zombies will eventually break it down themselves. Get in quick! Any luck yet? I'll get that for you. Sounds like it's getting closer. That's not too helpful. Get it off me. Get ready for a jolt. I can switch its affinity. Come on, then. Stay close, okay? Keep us covered, Freeman! Stuff around every corner... Oh great. It looks like they were deliberately trying to blow the reactor. Ah... it's still out there. In short, the Combine are completely cut off. Combine forces currently stationed on Earth are now isolated units. Stranded. I can hear 'em! [Fighting sounds] Come on, Dog, what are you doing? The Citadel's very unstable. We should have just enough time to make it out of here. Look! It's us! [Fighting sounds] Get away from there, Gordon! Let's go through here. See where it puts us. Behind you! We can't waste any time. You heard the old egghead! Get out of the city! Help me, Dog. Move this junk out of the way first. All right, Dad. I still don't know how he got out of there in the first place. Nice toss, Gordon. Look out! What is it? Oh! We made it! Sometimes I think everybody's a doctor but me. Aim for the head! Let me get this barrier and we'll deal with him. Okay, Gordon, I won't be much help against the strider, but I can find us a way out of here. Hold on and keep hammering at that thing. I'll be back as soon as I can. That's, that's like a...ah...a Zombine! Right? Heh... I mean, holy... A Combine zombie. Let's work it! Hah! Nope, guess I'm not. Combine defenses used to keep these antlions away. We'll distract the strider so you can get this train out of here. There's just so much of it...this is amazing... He and Judith got out ahead of us, in one of Dr. Breen's escape pods. They made it to a vortigaunt camp, way outside the city. Hopefully we still have time to make it there... [Scott Dalton] We designed this gunship battle to create a dynamic evolving experience while still keeping the player within a constrained area. Initially, this space appears straightforward, and provides plenty of cover. As the environment gets progressively more damaged, combat becomes more challenging; players are increasingly open to enemy fire and the path to the rocket crate becomes more difficult to navigate. As the roof breaks apart, however, the gunship also becomes more visible and therefore easier to hit, keeping things relatively in balance. The lighting in this area was tuned to play off of the HDR tonemapping effects, between the dark inner spaces and the progressively open bright sky above. Good. Ow! Good shot! Please, God, tell me you're out of the City! Breen falling, My Dad always talks about the Black Mesa train. Drop what you're doing and help me over here... [Adrian Finol] We're really happy with the zombine's grenade behavior. It adds sudden danger spikes to the zombie horde, which force players to quickly re-prioritize their targets. And since the player can grab a grenade out of the zombine's hand with the gravity gun, these danger spikes can be converted into offensive opportunities. This kind of turnaround skill shot creates some dynamic, satisfying hero moments for the player. Originally, we didn't allow the player to snatch zombine grenades because we felt it broke the fiction of the gravity gun - if players could grab a zombine's grenade, why couldn't they grab the Combine soldiers' guns? After playtesting the grenade steal, though, fun won out over consistency. I can't hear a thing... Ah, soldiers! Looks like they're too busy trying to get out of here to worry about us. This lift will take us to a train platform. Ha! You're good with that gravity gun. Poor souls. They're looking for something... What the hell did you just do? Company... Go on, boy, give it to Gordon. Find a way to get rid of that APC. [Pain sounds] I don't get it. Why are they hanging around here? There you are! It's friggin' dark... *pain* [Scott Dalton] At this point in the action, we really felt that we needed a combat crescendo. Antlion guards make great boss challenges, and we decided to add some combine forces to the mix because watching AI characters fight each other is always entertaining. This setup had a few other benefits as well. Since players had previously only fought alone against the guards, this was the first time they'd actually witness second hand the effects of a Guard headbutt. They'd also see an APC in action, and, in case there was any doubt, get definite proof that Combine soldiers and antlion guards don't get along, underscoring the collapse of Combine dominance in City 17. Overwatch soldiers! Watch your step. Weird... Oh God, I hate zombies. Get aboard! Antlions never got into the city in the old days. I mean, last week. This is it, Gordon. [Fighting sounds] That's, that's impossible Damn flash light! Hey - a map. [Gautam Babbar] This area is the dramatic culmination of all the lightless combat that comes before it. We wanted to create a dynamic fight that lasted several minutes while you waited for the elevator to arrive. The first iteration of this battle was very different from what we eventually shipped. The space was larger, had water in it, and wasn't completely dark. Water is relatively expensive, performance-wise, so we cut that in favor of more zombies. We made the level smaller to ensure that the player would see the elevator and recognize the problem that needed to be solved before the fight started. We killed the lights both to enhance tension and to make this scene a final test of the dark-fighting skills that the player develops over the course of the episode. Finally, we added a wire running along the ceiling from the elevator to the powerbox to give players a guide as they familiarize themselves with the area. Maybe we can use it against the sniper. Uh, good throw, Dog! Heads up! Got some trouble! I need that light! Ugh! I was in one of those pods. I can tell. Whew. You hear 'em...underground? [Ido Magal] Originally, the player didn't get any weapons until the end of this map, so rollermines were the only way to kill the soldiers. As we added more content to previous levels, it became impractical for players to be without a gun for so long. As a result, players get weapons much earlier now. Need that light! Let's try this way. Gordon, no! Hurry up, Gordon! Oh man...another powered lock... Something weird up there... Don't worry. Go on across, Gordon. Ah! Lost em! These things suck! Maybe we can still catch that one. Come on! That was close. Let's get moving. [Matt Scott] We wanted players to realize that they've been spotted and the Combine are now aware of their arrival at the train station. It sounds like a simple task, but it actually took a lot of thought to draw the player's attention to the various events that communicate this message. First, a train horn sounds, which gives Alyx an opportunity to mention that the station is in sight. Next, the lights go off to grab the player's attention and to make the monitors stand out in the dark. At this point, the player should be looking at one of the monitors, so, finally, the Kleiner transmission is interrupted briefly by a Combine advisor. Originally, the advisor appeared on a jumbotron outside, but we were never able to reliably make playtesters look at it. The flashing Combine camera should also provide some indication that trouble is brewing. Though it's not a proper gate, the zombie draped over the exit is designed to slow the player down just long enough for Alyx to finish her lines. Gordon! Whoa! [Pain sounds] Whoa... was close. Why? Zom-B-Q! Ohhhkay.... Yeah. [out of breath...] Company! If there were only some way to power up this bridge... A little help here, Gordon? I hear they put babies in those striders. He has to be somewhere around here. We've got to be close...just gotta be! One for the resistance! Let's go! Any time now... That's it! Look at em go! If Gordon and I took a separate route, we could draw the Combine away from you. Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman! You stayed behind to look after us, didn't you? I hear they put babies in those striders. Keep that barnacle in your light. [Pain sounds] Ah, I'm hurt, Gordon. Hey, the gravity gun! Give it to him, Dog. I'll be praying for you. We've gotta get through here. Good idea, Gordon! I'll be right back, Gordon. Ugh! Venom crabs - I hate those things. Wow... Light em up! Come on, we can't let one soldier with a rocket launcher stop us. Okay, Gordon, same as last time...get this bridge humming again. We can't leave till that strider's taken care of... Hit it again. And trouble's right behind me. I can't see a thing. [Dhabih Eng] The Combine core was another new space that needed to stand out from the rest of the environment. We wanted the core to look hot and dangerous, but still be distinct from the fires and the cool blues of the rest of the Citadel. The core became the primary light source in this space and in conjunction with the white set of Combine materials, we created an extreme contrast with the normally dark values of the Citadel metals. Where are these things coming from? We've still got a hike ahead of us... but it could have been worse. Hey, where are you going? Oh my god...they died like rats in a trap. Hey, great shot. Watch it! No! No time to lose. You mean we have to go back into the Citadel? I met Odessa Cubbage one time. What an idiot. Nice shot! Wait a minute... You're right - we don't have time to watch TV. They're all over! Dammit. Reloading. We've gotta get to the reactor. Still, I cannot overstate how important it is that we retain our humanity. Only this will allow us to hold together as we must for their inevitable return...and what is certain to be unimaginable retaliation. It's too dark. I wouldn't have thought you could plug up the burrow that way. See if the crank still works. Excellent. Good-a way out of this place. They might call 'em crabs, but I'll tell you what. They don't taste like crab. We gotta take it down! Let's find a terminal I can hack into and chart a path to the core. It's too dark. Go back and get another group. I'll stay here and guard the gate. I had no idea. And...oh yes, if you missed any part of this message, it will loop repeatedly until there is no point in looping it any longer. Here, get yourself patched up. They're dying all around me! Get it off me - get it off! Really? Well, if you say so. Go on, boy. Let's get some rollermines on our side. Hold up a sec... Gordon and I will draw their attention while you get the others away from here. Okay, it's good to go. You coming? I'll be right over there! Get it off me! Get it off! [Ido Magal] We separate Alyx from the player here to make the strider battle a more intimate combat experience. While we generally want Alyx to be useful to the player, bosses tend to require a specific combat style to beat, and we've found that it usually doesn't make gameplay sense to keep her around. Plus, boss battles are the player's big hero moments, and having too much help dilutes the sense of individual accomplishment. Alyx more or less sits out all of our boss encounters. Cover that spot where the antlions are coming through. Here they come! Since we took out Breen's reactor, this is the only way they have to send a transmission packet back to wherever they came from. [Jim Dose] For Episode One, we implemented a scripting component, called the 'Response Rules System', for dynamically managing NPC speech. We wanted to take NPC speech out of the hands of the programmers and let the writers control it. The writers were able to set up a wide range of situationally triggered character responses. For instance, Alyx has different reactions to different enemies, can warn the player of danger, calls for help when she's mobbed, and will ask for light. The combat responses worked out great, but it's especially satisfying when Alyx's comments on some situation mirror your own thoughts. The writers really went crazy with this, so be on the lookout for lots of little easter egg responses to unusual situations. Dog, what are you... Look at the size of this place. We're in your care, Dr. Freeman! Any thoughts about getting the power back on? We're in the same boat as the other evacuees now. Hey, I hear the elevator-it's moving again. Nice shooting! What's keeping you? Great! Good thinking! Watch out, Gordon! We should keep moving. [Erik Wolpaw] If you don't like Alyx, you're not going to have much fun with Episode One. So Alyx being likeable was one of our most crucial design goals. Little moments like the Zombine joke are designed to make Alyx more endearing. Since we like to multitask, it also had the practical purpose of introducing a new monster. The success of the scene relied on a combination of dialog, voice acting, and animation. Surprisingly, lighting was really important too. Under red light, Alyx's self-deprecating groan looked more like she was sneering at the player for not getting the joke. Changing the lighting to blue and then adjusting the direction of the light so that it changed the shadows on her face fixed the problem. It's powered up again, Gordon...like it was in Breen's reactor. That can only help where we're going... Dad?! As if regular bugs weren't bad enough... [Fighting sounds] What in god's name is that thing? Nice work. Ah, there you are... you scared me... I can't tell what the packet contains, but it's important enough that they're willing to sacrifice the whole Citadel to send it off. Okay - here comes a train. the fire's going out! Dog, really, throwing stuff at the Citadel isn't going to get us anywhere! The citadel could blow at any moment! You know, all things considered, [Ido Magal] Players didn't have any weapons in the original version of this map. That made it a lot more important to remove the boards with the gravity gun so that Alyx could snipe the zombies. Once weapons were added, though, the skybridge became less of a puzzle and more of straightforward a combat event. We added more zombies to increase the challenge, but pulling the boards off is still the most fun way to get through this section. There it is. There's a lot of em! Looks like the combine cut straight though the sublevel city...I wonder how far down we are... Let's check out where that sparking wire leads. I sure am. Let's go! It's coming for us! [Brian Jacobson] This dropship scene was another case where we had to be clever about drawing the player's attention to something cool that was about to happen, which the player could easily miss if they weren't looking in the right direction. We used a solitary soldier firing at the player to draw their attention to where the dropship climbs into view. Once the player notices the dropship, there's a good chance they'll watch it until the payoff when it crashes. We got company! The destabilization of the City 17 reactor has had repercussions that were not entirely unexpected, although we hardly dared speak this hope ahead of time. The destructive pulse forced a damper on the entire network of linked Citadel reactors. Thus, for the time being, I believe that all Combine portals have failed completely, as well as all communication systems based on that technology. Let me see if we can find a map. Here they come! Let's go. That'll slow them down, Soldiers! That was tougher than I thought. I'm going to line up another train for us. Take that! Last time through here, I couldn't see a thing. Oh no, the Kleiner speech is starting again. CAN'T SOMEONE MAKE IT STOP! Damn it! I can't unlock this one because- Keep moving! Oh no, gunship! Run! I'm fairly sure I've pinned down the location of the Project. Well, take it down, Gordon. Let's head for the next area. [Pain sounds] I think I'm getting better at this. I thought you were supposed to help us! Combine defenses used to keep these antlions away. Oh no, gunship! Run! Nice shot! Okay - let's get to the trainyard before the Citadel blows. Come on! You don't have to ask me twice. Let's go. There we go. Hold it there! Barney! We kept them off your back as long as we could. Careful, Gordon. I still don't know how we got out of there. I've got your back, Gordon. I promise. What's going on in there! We need to get the hell outta here. You did it! What is that...a zombie? [Shock sounds] That's how it's done. Get it off! Get it off! Stripped you for parts and left you to die? Any thoughts about getting the power back on? And Gordon... Haul ass! Let's team up with them. Whoa! We're not doing too... [Marc Laidlaw] Barney, like Dr. Kleiner, is one of the characters with the deepest roots in Half-Life 1. His personality is more iconic, and retains more of the comic stylization of the first game. This type of character allows us to mix up the mood a little bit - to inject some absurd humor into the otherwise grim scenarios of the Half-Life universe. While characters such as Alyx and Eli Vance have allowed us to explore more realistic dramatic possibilities, we are still very much attached to our roots in satire and black humor. Where are you? *pain* Well... Oh my God! Dog! Look around. Maybe the opener is still around somewhere. Careful...hold on... You've done this before, haven't you. GORDON! Headcrabs! Way to go! I've messed with its circuits so much, it'll burn out pretty quick. But it should be able to do some damage first. Shoot 'em! Look out! What are you doing in here? You need to clear out of the city. Bring one over here. I told you I knew he was around here somewhere. Luckily, we picked up the HEV signal, and then it was just a matter of digging. Toss one into the sniper's nest! I can't get it loose. Look out! But how... Just hurry, he's right behind me! Now, there's a cargo platform up ahead. Our best bet is to catch an express train out of the city. Whew! Hey, you still there? Oh! This wheel should do the trick. See if you can pull it off, Gordon. If I ever let my guard down... Nooooo! Get back, Doc. I'm sure you want to help everyone else get to safety first. Get away from the doors! Bring another group of citizens, Gordon! The last train's leaving! Get aboard! It's all right, Dad. It's not your fault. Let's go through here. Ah! Gordon, go for that gunship! Yes. How are we gonna get through that? It's my dad. Stay with me now. Whoa! We're going to have to find another way. Okay, Dog, let's get the monitor setup so we can check in. My Dad must be worried sick about us. Oh my god! Oh... Careful! Zombies! We've got to get to the core! I guess it was feeding on the runaway core. Somebody shed a tear. You guys coming? We'll have a better chance. [Charlie Burgin] In early versions of this area, there was no side passage off the street and the gash in the road was created by the gunship that the player later fights in the hospital attic. As development progressed, however, gameplay, story, and performance requirements made this initial design unworkable. The new side passage provided a short break in the combat tension after the boss battle and also helped us to stay within our performance budget. Careful, Lamarr! GORDON! Ah, you found one. Look up! Watch out! You got him! Dog, do you see anything up there that can help us get across? I think we can get through... Okay... Looks like we're gonna have to slug our way through here... the longer we take finding the trainstation, the more dangerous it gets. [Bill Van Buren] Sometimes, we need to keep the player in an area so that we can deliver some critical dialog or run an important sequence of events. In these cases, we temporarily block the player's path using what we call a 'gate'. These gates generally take the form of some obstacle that can only be removed or opened by some character or event. In this case, the obstacle is a crashed gunship that can only be moved out of the way by Dog. Though the final scene looks pretty straightforward, a lot of care had to be taken to make sure that Dog hit his marks and played his sequences without trampling and damaging the player. The vortigaunts had a hand in it, Give me a second. Hey, a scanner! No eye contact with Combine soldiers. Damn battery! Sounds good. Let's throw some more rollermines in there. Hey, and you found a gun! [Fighting sounds] Oh well...I don't have a trophy room anyway. Scanners! Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman! You stayed behind to look after us, didn't you? Light that thing up! Ok, let's go! [Ted Backman] We revealed the pod here to let players see it up close. At the same time, we didn't want the player to get too good a look at what's inside. An old version of this scene had the pod simply hanging from the ceiling. It would burst open and then charge up your gravity gun, but not do much else. The current scene gives us a much more dramatic reveal of the pod and an opportunity to introduce the mind blast it's capable of emitting. Though they don't play a large role in Episode One, these guys were a functional requirement of Episode Two, which meant we effectively had to ship a piece of that episode early. Oh no. You're not serious? [Robin Walker] You fight alongside Alyx for much of Episode One, so her combat really needed to look varied and exciting. We especially wanted to get her into some convincing physical contact with her enemies. We'd always wanted to do this kind of dynamic character interaction, but getting the NPCs into position for their interactions has a wide-ranging set of problems. We ended up taking an opportunistic approach for Episode One; Instead of figuring out how to maneuver characters into proximity, the system monitors their positions, and fires the appropriate animations whenever it notices that they're correctly aligned. Given how well these interactions worked out between Alyx and zombies, headcrabs, and antlions, we're looking forward to extending this kind of behavior to all of our NPCs. We can do this, Dad. Dead...heh. You're my new hero! Hey, Freeman. Get back out there and help. Now we just gotta mop up the stragglers! We'll see about that. That's the last burrow. What? Wait a minute... Oh no. You're not serious? Hey, Dr. Freeman, I heard you were there when Odessa Cubbage took down the first gunship? That must have been a real honor for you. I'm proud to say I met someone who knew Odessa Cubbage. They're getting aboard! Let's keep it up! While there was certainly a great benefit in destroying the Citadel's teleport core, we have detected one rather unfortunate side effect. A barnacle! Oh no, they're coming out again! Yeah. Thanks... It's gone now. Did you get a look at it? *laughter* But how? Looks like we're going on foot from here. Mm hm. We're all just targets to them now. They're counting on you! On a lighter note, if you are already in one of our designated safe zones, I feel obliged to point out that a more fortunate side-effect of the reactor's destruction is the complete removal of the Combine's reproductive suppression field. Let me just check our location. Out again. That sniper almost took my head off. Here it goes. Ah - I gotta reload. Their leader's gone! Why the hell are they sticking around? Into the core, yes. But it's far too dangerous to consider. The chamber will be bathed in radiation. Turn on your flashlight, Gordon. Zombie Combine. Izzy, talk some sense into her! What idiot put Kleiner in charge? Let's go. What idiot put Kleiner in charge? Uh oh... Let's keep going. Gordon! Help! I've still gotta get that powerbox going! Let's head for the next train! You guys go ahead, I'll bring the next batch of citizens around! While you were in there, I did some poking around in the control data. Hey, you found the landlord's apartment. I heard two people were coming up. I'm gonna wait till you're both here. I can't see it! Looks like we need to find you a medkit. [out of breath...] Something tells me they don't want us reading their mail. Gross! They're coming! Gordon, help! The train's all set. Hop on and I'll get us going. Watch out I'd like to find another way around these buildings, I heard vortigaunts. Rot in hell! What's that, Eli? Oh, right. [Gautam Babbar] This turret scenario was designed to showcase Alyx's ability to provide cover for players in combat. She always hangs back a little, blasting anything that moves. In the original version, players could knock over the lightly protected turrets with a single rocket fired from the safe end of the corridor. We thought it'd be a nice way for players to feel like they'd pulled one over on the Combine. Unfortunately, playtesters routinely thought that they'd discovered a bug or, at best, an exploit that had arisen from sloppy design. So, in this case, a situation we'd deliberately created to make players feel clever actually caused them to think we weren't doing our job very well. As a result of this feedback, we added a force field and additional grating to better protect the turrets. Get the hell out of here! Help - please! Huh, there's more of them down there. Looks like they had designs on this train. Let's stick together in here. Now...where did I put that calculator...? Right there. No problem! They'd have been coming through years ago otherwise. Gordon, be careful! I can get a better shot if you knock them over, Gordon. This isn't going to be easy. We got a live one! Are you crazy? Er, well, don't answer that. But we really don't have time. It used to be safer here. Get up! [defeated] Oh god no... Look up there! I don't remember seeing anything like this on the map. [Matt T. Wood] Since we never take control away from the player, it can be a real pain to get them to notice important environmental events. It's a constant design challenge for us. The Citadel will be erupting in a massive light show that took ten of us two months to orchestrate, and, if we're not careful, the player will end up facing the other direction staring at a tire. In this case, to establish that the Citadel is coming apart at the seams, we wanted the player to notice the debris falling off of it. We used a pretty straightforward method here - Alyx explicitly mentions the citadel while pointing at it. Like most of these solutions, it's not foolproof, but it has a high success rate. Take them to the train! Alyx, oh my god, where's Freeman!?! Oh, there he is... It's Judith! Watch out--turrets! [Matt T. Wood] Usually, the second step of our training arcs involve a threatening training area. This is the second step in the rollermine training, and true to form, there's a threat. The indestructible rollermines endlessly attack the player in a gated space. The only way to defeat them is to have Alyx convert them, which means there's no way the player can miss the point of the training. Players also like to see the AI characters fight each other, so after reminding the player about Alyx's rollermine hacking talent, we let you sic them on a pack of Combine soldiers. Between you and me, I don't trust those Vortigaunts. Kill the gunship! Come back! This lift will take us to a train platform. Okay then...don't take too long about it, yeah? Oh, crap! Well that was a nice clean getaway. I wish you wouldn't do that, Gordon. The stalkers are no threat to us now. The packet's done copying. One second... Holy crap...we've got to cross through that? Come on, Gordon, block the hole or they'll never stop coming! Every one of them was a person who resisted the Combine. Here comes more! I told you I knew he was around here somewhere. You walked into a barnacle! Keep your light on it, Gordon! Ahhhhhhh got a problem! What's wrong with this lift? We should... Who are you again? Shine your flashlight on the powerbox so I can work on it. You're supposed to wait till everyone else is on board first. That thing's gonna chew us up! Oh, that weapon is definitely you. I'd better capture this. Maybe we can find out what they know about our operations. [Shock sounds] Uh-oh - they're coming through. Where the hell does he think he's going? Kleiner. What is that...a zombie? Okay, Alyx, okay... Just promise me-- If the site is where we think it is, then it should be no more than... Well... I made it! We can leave now! Sorry about leaving you alone down there, Gordon. Light please! The whole city's going to look like this soon... You mean...going in? They're coming out of the woodwork. Whatever it is, Your vent-crawling skills seem to be in high demand today, Gordon. I understand, Dad. Now stay with us... You can do better than that! Watch out! Looks like a firefight down there. I still don't know how he got out of there in the first place. Help! Their leader's gone! Why the hell are they sticking around? Gordon's a man of few words. Why hadn't they left the city already? Damn zombies. Light please! Uh oh, we missed that one. I'd like to find another way around these buildings, I haven't seen one of those all day. Okay, what now? Keep up! The containment field must have failed. It's Judith. This is our train. Oh my God! Hey, did you hear something? Look out! [out of breath...] Ah! Hey! You're Alyx Vance! It's gonna tear us apart! Go find Dad. Oh no, an APC. These antlions must be coming from the subways. Plug those holes! What kind of hospital is this? Sorry I haven't been more help getting the power back on. They're everywhere! Don't worry, Dad. [Scott Dalton] The goal of this logic puzzle isn't figuring out that you need to put balls in the batteries, it's coming to the realization that by filling all of them, you've denied yourself an exit, and that you have to desocket one, climb on the lift, and then resocket it. Sparks guide the player to the source of the balls, which happens to be the tube they just passed through. Don't worry... Uh-oh, looks like we're gonna need another train. Come on, people. Let's figure this out. No! Make it stop! Here we go. [Shock sounds] Okay... Give me a hand! It's too dark! I need that light! Forget about packing up - let's just get out of here. We'll do what we can. Come on, Gordon. Holy crap, Antlions! I know you didn't mean to do that, Gordon. Still, it is annoying. That one's covered in stinkin' venom crabs! We'll see you at the train station. Let's get the power back on and get the hell outta here. Light em up! The train's about full. Let's finish up here and start getting people onto another one! That transmission's going out after all. Ah, more of em coming... The control system is going crazy. Looks like they're compressing a huge packet of data. Defend the citizens... I have a feeling it's bad news for all of us. [Jeff Hameluck] We often use goodies - such as this crate and the scanner battery around the corner - to guide players along a preset route. We want players to hit their marks during a battle without drawing attention to the fact that they're being subtly manipulated down a particular path. If we could just stop those antlions from swarming in here. Stay close to us, boy. Hey, how much long on that light? One for the resistance! Hey, good job with the strider Oh, that was close! Why didn't they leave with the rest of the Combine? Sorry about leaving you alone down there, Gordon. Okay, let's put it to work. What? Wait a minute... Oh no. You're not serious? Dog, watch the signal. We'll be seeing my Dad before long. What the hell! Get in! Get in! Got it. Don't kill the Combine representatives. We've gotta get through here. I need light here, Gordon. Let's try this instead. Talk about unstable. Something holding you up? Hmmm. How are we gonna get this open? They're getting aboard! Good work! Glad to help! We continue to diligently assemble and train a new generation of scientists and technicians. All right, all right. You've got to be kidding... another powered lock. Even more reason to hurry. Wow, you really killed the hell out of that padlock. Block off the antlion burrow! Did you see that? Did you see that? Doing good! I wonder if there's any good meat on this thing. How could anyone be alive in there? Hold back - grab me one of those rollermines. Can you see the top? Get aboard! There are probably other ways to the core Let's find out exactly where we're going. So that's a headcrab...huh... Soldiers! Let's head out. I'm coming! When the coast is clear, I'll catch up. [Charlie Brown] We populate our environments with spots where players can take a break to look out over an expanse of cool scenery. We call these 'vistas'. This particular vista was designed to give anyone familiar with the Citadel interior from Half-Life 2 a good view of what it looks like now that everything's falling apart. The pods that are sliding off their track and into the abyss really sell the idea that the Citadel is half-abandoned and in chaos. He's alive! Get him out, Dog! Well - the hard part's over. If that's all of them we should get this train moving. Try planting some of these bouncebombs... Could you watch the door for a minute? Make sure nobody comes in? Are you sure you want to do that? It used to be safer here. I'm sending folks out in groups. Ah, I need to find some medkits. Damn...it's got a powered lock. It's losing power Sh! Traitors! [Lars Jensvold] Apart from being a big visual payoff to the episode, there were several story requirements that this ending sequence needed to convey. It had to make it very clear that the Citadel was destroyed, that the Citadel pods had escaped, and it needed to imply that a data transmission beam was streaming out of the ruins. We discovered that Alyx had to be mostly silent during this scene or else players tended to look at her instead of all of the chaos around them. Over here! Trouble here! I don't believe it! Soldiers! Sounds like the elevator's moving again. Oh my God... I'd say their security device backfired. Give me another roller to hack. I hate to say this, Gordon, but it looks like we've got to find another powerbox. I'll keep an eye on things. Let it go now. One down. It's a stalker car. Whatever's in that transmission packet, What're we gonna do? Ohh! Not for much longer if we don't get out of here. Hold it... Gordon, kick it into the hall. Pull Oh no! Hurry and let's get out of here! Not if we don't get moving. C'mon! It's back to zero. I hope you've still got that crank. There's nothing else we can do now, I guess, except hope we can get far enough before it... Hurry! [Giddy laughter] Oh god oh god... Heads up! Thank God. Now let's get out of here. We've been trying to reach him for hours. Good thinking. We're really moving now... They were trying to start a chain reaction, all right... Alyx - honestly, do you think we have any chance? Hmm... let's see if we can find a way into the Citadel from somewhere along the rim. Yeah! Traitors! In addition to the completely xenotheric species, there are many modified post-human allies still remaining on Earth who will be doing their utmost to re-establish lines of communication and supply with the larger forces. Bye, Barney! Good luck! Here's your elevator. Nice! Look out! Looks like this could be a transport elevator to the core. You bet. Let's go. but I didn't have time to map anything but this one route. I love you, too, baby. Give me a sec! [Chuckle] Shoot 'em! I'm gonna go ahead and guard this point and keep people moving toward the trains. You okay down there? Can you get it going again? If we don't get to the core soon Come on, come on...make it, make it... Are you there? Look out! Probably us. Well, Gordon...unless you have a better suggestion... He is a robot. He's done the math. It's a raid! Lost my target! Come on! To the stations! You're not looking so well. Defend us, Freeman! Jump on, Gordon. I'm right behind you. Now it looks like we're gonna have to cut a path through every chickenshit metrocop who's having second thoughts about defending City 17. Cover the burrows! Let me see if I can get some juice going here. Try not to do that again, okay? It'll sure come in handy if it stays that way. Lost another one! Isaac, please. Get it off! A huge explosion... and then... Get this thing moving! Thanks. What's - argh! Uh oh-the antlions are coming up here! Where the hell is she? Oh my God! [Robin Walker] What you're seeing here is a visual representation of a nodegraph - a set of nodes and the connections between them. Nodegraphs tell our NPCs how they can move around the world. It's not a specific set of instructions, but rather a sort of information repository. Among other things, NPCs use the nodegraph to dynamically chart paths to distant areas, find cover, and scout out firing positions with a clear line of sight to their enemy. Gordon [Steve Bond] The difference between skill levels isn't just a matter of damage dealt and received. For instance, in easy mode, we increase the length of time a Combine ball survives before exploding, putting less pressure on the player to get the ball into a socket. Ugh... Damn! We have to protect them! Hand here, please! All right, now I can shut this off. What are you doing? I can't see! Hmmm. Dog? A little help please? We're sitting ducks in here. Or maybe fish in a barrel. Anyway, it's not good. Hey! Come on, Gordon, keep moving. I know you! I've been pulling down a copy. Damn. Hey, a hospital! Keep an eye out for medical supplies. Yeah, well looks can be deceiving. There's got to be some way to pull this cable tighter. I could use some backup! Holy crap! I think I know that guy! I don't believe it, an actual elevator! I would have settled for stairs. Look at all these Breen busts. There it goes. I found a shotgun! This is gonna sound crazy, but I kinda miss the Combine. Plug those holes! Good job, Gordon. Let's not hang around in here. Dr. Kleiner said it would all heat up again soon. The best thing you can do is run defense. That... Oh my god... Wow... Hurry and let's get out of here! I see it! Uh oh... He, he, yeah! Watch out! Heeellllpp!!! It looks pretty far gone. They killed the new guy! Okay, you're clear. Get into the lift and I'll send you in. Crap! Oh my god! Incoming! Good job, Gordon. Oh...thank God... Take out the APC. [Pain sounds] Shriek! That's a Zom-B-Q right there! *laughter* What are you still doing here? Everyone should clear out of the city. Thanks, Alyx. On foot to a train station. Let's go. We've really got to talk to Dr. Kleiner about getting a new battery for that flashlight. Holy crap! Look up! Whoa! [Pain sounds] It'd be nice to not have to rely on that flashlight. So much for sneaking in. That'd give you a chance to get the trains filled up before we get there. What are you two doing? Poor souls. You guys know about the evacuation trains, right? Thank god we're not on foot. Come on, let's get in. Kill it! Ah...I see what I did wrong. We won't have light, but at least I can get the door open now. Uh, is Dr. Kleiner really telling everyone to ... 'get busy' ? Bring me a rollermine. Uh huh. Stop, please I'm right here. Looks like we've found a troop train. Gordon? Ah, that was close. or if you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I'll leave you to it. Our remote sensors indicate the process is accelerating toward a dark-energy flare. Hey down there! Stop up those burrows and we'll let you through! Go on without us. We've got stuff to do. Someone must have been keeping a secret museum here, Gordon. These are treasures of human history. Something's on me! [out of breath...] Move 'em out! Hey, the gravity gun! It's gonna tear us apart! It sees us! Sniper! I'd have settled for stairs. They're coming out of those holes! Give it a jolt with the gravity gun. I've secured an exit elevator. Rollermines! Move that white car out of the way so we can get through! It's hopeless! Bingo! Oh...I thought we'd never get out of there. There! This guy's one of ours now. Well, it doesn't look good, but Gordon here's worked miracles before. Good shot! Hell yeah! Can't see where I'm going. Okay, we'll let you through! Reloading! That was a close one. Hurry up! If we can hitch a ride it should take us straight out of the city. It's here! Oh my God...the transmission's going out. Luckily, we picked up the HEV signal, and then it was just a matter of digging. Can't see it! Hang on... It's hard to say how much of it might have survived intact, or whether there's anything remaining that could compromise our work... [Jake Nicholson] Originally, the player couldn't operate the power boxes and would have to wait for Alyx to do it. We thought it'd be entertaining to watch Alyx do some cool thing while you protected her. Unfortunately, that didn't work out. Playtesters were more annoyed than entertained. The other problem was that having Alyx committed to a particular activity while action was still going on in the world tended to quickly expose her most robotic tendencies. She'd either ignore what was going on or completely stop whatever activity the player was waiting for her to finish. Either way, it was unconvincing and frustrating. We learned that whenever Alyx commits to some action in a dynamic environment, she needs to finish it quickly and move on. So much for medical supplies Up there! This looks like the teleport in Nova Prospekt. You two head that way. Come on! Get off the street! The Combine's moving into this area! Ugh, headcrabs! Run! Nice work blocking those burrows. Go ahead, I'm right behind you. Need some help! Thanks, Freeman! Damn it! How 'bout this weather? Yeah. They'll have it on the other side soon. Why can't they all be like Lamarr? Eh, I fed it a little bit too much power that time... Oh great. Huh, I wish we had a map. Looks like a shrine to Dr. Breen. Good thing you know what you're doing. It looks powered up again, Gordon... Take out the APC. Get in quick! Oh, I hate these things! Stalkers!
